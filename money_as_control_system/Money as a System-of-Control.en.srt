1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:09,280
The topic of today's talk is an interesting property
of money that I want to explore with you.

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,820
I am calling this [talk],
"Inside Out: [Money as a System of Control]."

3
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:22,320
Who here wants to tell me what the four 
primary functions of money are? Anybody?

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,680
[AUDIENCE] Value exchange? 
[ANDREAS] Medium of exchange, that is one.

5
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:30,020
[AUDIENCE] Fungibility? 
[ANDREAS] Store of value, that is two.

6
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:36,100
[AUDIENCE] Fungibility? [ANDREAS] No. 
That is not a use case for money, but it is a property.

7
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:44,640
Two more. Unit of account, very good.
What is the fourth? System-of-control (SoC).

8
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:51,540
What? I don't remember reading that. 
[Laughter] System of control, as it turns out.

9
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:59,920
We have had money for tens of thousands of years.
It is really hard to tell how far back money goes.

10
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,200
But the money we have today is very different
from the money we have had in the past;

11
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:09,300
something changed in the last 50 years that
has fundamentally altered the course of money,

12
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:16,390
of currency, [which is a] system [for] 
communicating value to other people.

13
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:23,960
We have the three components: medium of exchange
(MoV), unit of account (UoA), and store of value (SoV).

14
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:30,460
Those have been around for millenia.
And then something happened.

15
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:40,130
In 1970, Richard Nixon signed the Bank Secrecy
Act and turned money into a system of control.

16
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:52,300
A system of control that uses money as a political tool,
to control who is able to send or receive it...

17
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,560
and who [you] are able to send money to.

18
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:06,220
Ultimately, it aims [for] the complete surveillance
of all financial transactions worldwide.

19
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:14,200
Complete, total, totalitarian financial surveillance.

20
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:22,300
This change, 50 years ago, has gradually 
percolated throughout every country in the world,

21
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:27,760
every financial service in the world,
every bank in the world.

22
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:38,380
In 1970, Richard Nixon deputised the financial services
field, to turn them into a branch of law enforcement.

23
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:49,460
Law enforcement that is beyond borders,
beyond jurisdictions, beyond due-process,

24
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:56,460
beyond political democratic control and recourse.

25
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:03,720
A cop can confiscate your money. A judge 
can sign a warrant to freeze your accounts.

26
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:13,220
A bank can do both without authorisation from anyone
and there is nothing you can do about it.

27
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:22,520
This applies world-wide. Money as a system of control
supercedes all other functions of money.

28
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:29,820
When money is turned into an enforcement tool,
the other functions start eroding.

29
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:38,040
It is no longer the best medium of exchange,
because its function as a medium of exchange...

30
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:45,780
is subordinate to its function as a system
of law enforcement, a system of control.

31
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:53,200
The system of control aspect corrupts everything.

32
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,420
We are now 25 years into the internet revolution.

33
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:03,960
Smartphones, cellphones, dumb phones... [tools for
accessing the internet] have propagated out to...

34
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:10,260
more than 2.5 billion people who have 
never had these technologies before.

35
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:16,180
But where is finance?
Lagging fifteen to twenty years behind.

36
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:21,980
[Financial services] have not yet reached 
2.5 billion people who are completely unbanked;

37
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:25,580
4 billion people underbanked.

38
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:33,180
Only about 1.5 billion people have the
full, privileged, elite form of banking...

39
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:37,400
that we enjoy in most western liberal democracies.

40
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:47,020
Even there, there are tiers of access and control.
How many people in this room are accredited investors?

41
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:54,120
Mhm, what a lovely bunch. [Laughter]

42
00:04:54,120 --> 00:05:03,240
That puts you in the 1/10 of the 1/10
of the 1/10 percentile of the world.

43
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,280
There are tiers within the financial system.

44
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:12,860
Some people who have better access and recourse,
and some people who have complete immunity.

45
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:23,160
Some people can commit crimes against millions:
robo foreclosures, Libor fraud, rigging the gold markets.

46
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,040
And no one will ever go to jail. Why?

47
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:33,820
Because when money becomes a system of control,
financial services companies become deputies...

48
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,300
in this system of enforcement and control.

49
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:45,720
As deputies, they get some perks.
One of the perks is: they never go to jail.

50
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,640
Well, with a few exceptions; there are some
fundamental rules that always apply to our society.

51
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:57,800
Bernie Madoff went to jail. He made the mistake of
stealing from rich people. Don't do that! [Laughter]

52
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:08,740
Foreclose [the homes of] 10 million poor people? Create
3.5 million fake accounts in Wells Fargo? No problem.

53
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:14,560
Lose 143 million private records of 
individuals [through a hack] at Equifax?

54
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:21,140
Let's see some bets.
How many executives [will] go to jail? None.

55
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:30,120
A system of control corrupts the basis of money until
it can no longer function as a medium of exchange.

56
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,040
It breeds economic exclusion.

57
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:40,280
We are now 25 years into the era of the internet and
we are reaching fewer people with economic inclusion.

58
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,400
We are actually backtracking historically.

59
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:50,620
Increasingly, entire countries are being
cut off from the world financial system.

60
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,979
You don't act in the best interests of the United States?

61
00:06:53,979 --> 00:06:59,470
You lose your SWIFT code, you are no 
longer part of the wire transfer network.

62
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:07,160
You [will] submit to the universal jurisdiction
of American courts, like Switzerland had to do,

63
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,320
or you lose access to international banking.

64
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:15,440
You lose access to the reserve currency, 
you lose access to the lifeblood [of trade].

65
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:24,160
This devil's bargain has made financial services
unassailable from a point of competition.

66
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:33,440
They are surrounded by a thicket of regulations;
these regulations are not about consumer protection,

67
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,320
consumers are most certainly not protected.

68
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:40,260
They are most certainly about
the system of control of money.

69
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:51,560
They are about the policy enforcement, and sometimes
politics enforcement, that comes with money.

70
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:57,020
Money does not flow freely.

71
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:09,560
I have some bad news. Those gold bars surrounding and
protecting banks from competition are a gilded cage.

72
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:16,200
A cage that keeps them inside a system of
regulation, prevents competition from the outside,

73
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:22,680
but also prevents them from acting on innovative
[ideas] in free markets, expanding their businesses,

74
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:27,680
unless they subordinate it
to a system of control.

75
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:33,020
The store-of-value [use case] no longer works;
you cannot store value in a currency...

76
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:39,140
that can be confiscated at a whim,
frozen by any banker, at any point in time.

77
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:42,020
That is not a stable store of value.

78
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:50,240
You cannot use it as your currency reserve to buy oil,
or as your foreign exchange reserve in your country.

79
00:08:50,240 --> 00:09:01,700
If you cross the superpowers, they will cut off
your access and you will not be able to [buy] oil.

80
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:09,600
You cannot use money as a medium of exchange
if you cannot exchange it freely with whoever you want.

81
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:17,060
Gradually, the corruption spreads and spreads.

82
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:25,040
Now, something new arrives on the horizon:
a system of money that [operates] on a network.

83
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:33,280
It is first and foremost a medium of exchange, a store
of value, and one day (potentially) a unit of account.

84
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:40,800
But it will never become a system of control;
it refuses to become a system of control.

85
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:53,600
In fact, its design principles are about neutrality,
openness, borderless access, censorship resistance.

86
00:09:53,600 --> 00:10:04,120
The banks can't play in that space. They are stuck
inside their gilded cage, playing cop for superpowers...

87
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:11,480
and [only] offering [financial] services to
a tiny fraction of the human population.

88
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:22,329
They are sacrificing 4 billion people on the 
altar of poverty in order to create a nice, fake,

89
00:10:22,329 --> 00:10:29,800
bourgeois sense of security among
the middle class -- by selling them lies.

90
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:38,009
FDIC: 'Don't worry, your money is insured.' Right?

91
00:10:38,009 --> 00:10:44,920
How many people here have FDIC or equivalent
insurance on their bank accounts?

92
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:49,300
How many Greeks do you think had 
insurance on their bank accounts?

93
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:56,400
All of them. What happened to that?
[Their savings went] poof! in one afternoon.

94
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,080
Vanished, with a 20% haircut.

95
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:07,620
Whose insurance? Does it insure you or does it
insure the banks? What does it insure against?

96
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:14,240
Small failure, not big failures.
Big failures are uninsureable.

97
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:22,740
How many of you have money in banks?
None of you have money in banks. [Laughter]

98
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:32,140
I mean, please. Many of you are lawyers, right?
You understand bailment. It is not your money.

99
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:38,820
You have an "account," which is a legal construct
that they give you in exchange for giving them...

100
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:44,780
your money as an unsecured loan, so that
they can finance credit to their customers.

101
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:49,320
Legally, you don't own any of
the money that is in your account!

102
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:57,480
You have a legal construct that possibly, maybe
entitles you to withdraw at the pace they [set],

103
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:07,860
unless you cross the wrong person, go to the wrong
protest, associate with the wrong organisation,

104
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,580
or vote for the wrong party.

105
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:12,540
Sure, maybe that is not happening in Canada.

106
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:18,220
But out of a hundred and ninety-four countries, this
model of turning money into a system of control...

107
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:23,720
has taken off like wildfire,
because it is every dictator's wet dream.

108
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:32,320
It ensures that political dissent can be 
snuffed at the bank, very effectively.

109
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,900
It is one of the most effective
systems of control that exist.

110
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:45,700
Now it has to face competition from a system
that will not do that, cannot be made to do that,

111
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:52,340
will not yield or be co-opted.

112
00:12:52,340 --> 00:13:00,200
What is the response? "Bitcoin is a joke."
"Cryptocurrencies are outside the system."

113
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:07,260
"Nobody wants to be outside the system." 
Guess what? There are 6 billion people out there.

114
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:11,460
[Most of them] don't want to be outside the 
system; they would much rather be inside.

115
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:16,340
But they haven't been invited
and they probably won't be.

116
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:23,240
Many of them can't do the things that are
necessary to be invited into the system.

117
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:34,100
Guess what? There is an entire generation that
has discovered the two [vital] forms of power:

118
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:39,120
the first form is voice,
the second form is exit.

119
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:45,200
You either speak up with your voice, and 
express your political will to force change.

120
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:53,340
When that doesn't work, you [opt for] the 
second [vital[ power that all humans have: exit.

121
00:13:53,340 --> 00:14:01,960
Borders have been erected for millenia
to prevent exit, to slow down exit.

122
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:11,200
You can't easily emigrate, opt out, depart, exit.

123
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:16,840
What happens when exit is not
a physical act, but a virtual act?

124
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:23,320
What happens when people decide to exit 
from the financial system in a virtual way?

125
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:29,680
VR-exit? Bit-exit? [Laughter]

126
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:34,819
You can keep the inside of the gilded cage.

127
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:44,080
It is demographically stagnated, over-leveraged, 
swimming in debt, and out of control.

128
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:49,240
It serves a tiny sliver of the population. You can keep it.

129
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:56,840
An entire generation of Millennials no longer 
believe in that fiction of bank security,

130
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:05,459
of deferred earnings, of interest rates and mortgages.

131
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:09,900
They will exit; they are exiting in droves.

132
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:17,280
Not just here, but even more so in the countries
where the existing system of insider finance...

133
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:23,220
and the system of control are
used despotically, oppressively.

134
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:28,220
China is exiting in droves and it has barely started.

135
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:36,560
Bitcoin has been around for nine years. 
What does the insider group do?

136
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:42,320
What do the regulators do in response
to a system that cannot be regulated?

137
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:53,800
They regulate the bits they can: the exchanges,
bank accounts, and national currency side of things.

138
00:15:53,800 --> 00:16:03,260
They shut down the on-ramps and off-ramps. 
They say, "We will not let you take your money with you."

139
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:08,900
What do Millennials say to that? 
"Dude... I don't have any fucking money!"

140
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:17,200
[Laughter] "All I have is my creative 
potential, my spirit, my productivity."

141
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:24,900
"I can sell that directly for bitcoin without 
an exchange, an on-ramp or an off-ramp."

142
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:29,680
"When I need to buy something,
I will use my digital currency directly...

143
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:34,840
without re-entering your system
- to which I was never invited."

144
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:42,540
"Shut down the on-ramps, shut down the off-ramps.
I will stay on board. I will stay digital."

145
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:51,120
I won't touch your gilded cage anymore, 
because I don't need you. I exit." Thank you.
