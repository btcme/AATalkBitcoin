1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:09,840
The title of today's talk is: "Fake News, Fake Money:
Living in a World Without Authority."

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:21,300
"Fake news" has been in the news a lot lately. 
You have all of these accusations swirling around.

3
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:27,640
The established media -- The New York Times,
the Washington Post -- are pointing fingers and saying,

4
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:34,560
“These [are the] purveyors of fake news!" 
Primarily at internet-based, [alternative media].

5
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:42,040
[The internet] is pointing right back and 
[asking], "Do you remember Judith Miller?"

6
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:51,660
Who remembers Judith Miller? 
“There are WMDs with aluminum tubes in Iraq!” Bullshit.

7
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:57,969
'Fake news' happens on both sides, right? 
That is really the perplexing thing.

8
00:00:57,969 --> 00:01:04,720
How did we arrive in the world when we 
can’t even tell what is true and what isn’t?

9
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:13,820
Well-established backbones of "authority" and "truth,"
like the Washington Post and New York Times,

10
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:21,280
or even CNN, Fox News, and other [television stations
like] CBS and ABC, and what are they doing?

11
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:30,960
They are cheer-leading for war based on false premises. 
And that was just last week, again!

12
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:39,289
Not Iraq, but Syria this time! Did we learn nothing? 
We didn’t learn anything.

13
00:01:39,289 --> 00:01:43,300
How did we arrive at this world? 
Why do we have this debate over fake news?

14
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:50,740
Part of it has to do with the rise of the internet
in the early '90s. Work with me here.

15
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:53,820
Let’s walk through the steps.

16
00:01:53,820 --> 00:02:04,200
The internet didn’t disrupt newspapers and television
companies by "stealing" their audience for news;

17
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,580
that came much, much later.

18
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:15,180
First, the internet disrupted their
sources of most profitable revenue.

19
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:22,480
For newspapers, that was the classified advertising
section, where they made most of their money.

20
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,480
Small business advertising in the classified section.

21
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:32,140
The internet came along and Craigslist-ed
that shit, just completely undermined it.

22
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:37,000
Now you can do all of that [online,
almost] free and instantaneous. Boom!

23
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:46,900
Suddenly, all of their most profitable revenue
disappears and the newspapers have to adapt.

24
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,709
Then it happened again with television.

25
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:57,780
They started losing advertising revenue to new popular
websites that were [attracting] more eyeballs.

26
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:05,500
First they lost the local and small advertisers, who were
able to position ads to target specific demographics...

27
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,900
and audiences, because they could [gather] 
much more fine-grained information.

28
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:22,720
Television is a one-way thing, you have [little to]
no idea who is watching. So what do they do?

29
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:32,520
Trim the fat. In newspapers, that’s journalists. 
"We don't really need them. No foreign desk, cut that."

30
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,060
"Investigative journalism, cut that."

31
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:38,620
What is selling more papers?

32
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:49,340
'AskJudy', the astrology section, infotainment,
cartoons, sensationalist news... "If it bleeds, it leads."

33
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:55,780
Inexorably, the long downtrend
of the news industry started.

34
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:02,080
They gutted their foreign desks, gutted their
investigative journalism, gutted their fact-checking,

35
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,740
gutted their copy editor desks.

36
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:14,560
What was left? A bunch of interns, running around
copying press releases from powerful corporations...

37
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:21,660
and presenting them as fact; taking notes when
someone seemingly important said something.

38
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:27,180
Not questioning any of it, just writing it 
down and publishing it as "the truth."

39
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:37,200
"Fake news" happened because the very basis for
producing truth was removed from the institutions...

40
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,100
whose job it was to produce truth.

41
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:48,880
This caused a very weird situation.
Until that time, how do you know if something is true?

42
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,960
Well, the New York Times said it. 
The Washington Post said it.

43
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:59,590
It was on CBS. Surely, they have fact-checked it? 
Therefore, it is the truth.

44
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:06,430
The fundamental basis for discovery
of truth was to examine the source.

45
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:12,980
When you go to college and write essays,
they ask, "What are you basing this argument on?"

46
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:18,580
"Give me citations." "Source your argument."
"Where are the facts?"

47
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:24,620
If you took a headline from the New York Times
and sourced it, they would say, “Okay, great."

48
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:29,639
"That is a citation from a valid source.”

49
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:35,960
We used the issuer to determine
the quality of what they issued.

50
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:42,700
We looked at the authority of the news based
on the authority of the institution that said it.

51
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:50,700
Because that was a good model, a good heuristic. 
It gave us a good false-positive, false-negative ratio.

52
00:05:50,700 --> 00:06:02,660
It was a bet, a way to say, “I can’t fact-check all [of
these claims], but these people have, so if I read it...

53
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:08,060
I will become not only educated but informed.”

54
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:14,160
Now we are in the situation where the people who watch
the most television and read the most newspapers...

55
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,280
are [often] the least informed part of the electorate.

56
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:28,840
How did that happen? The institutions are still standing. 
Their authority is still standing in some eyes.

57
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:37,580
The basis of credibility is still there. They still have
the big buildings, circulation, and big names.

58
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:48,200
But the mechanism that delivered truth, that ensured
quality, is no longer there or significantly eroded.

59
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:59,200
What is their response to that? "We will try harder"? No.
They turn to the internet and shout, “You’re fake news!”

60
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:09,080
Arguably, a lot of the stuff on the internet is fake news,
because it never had any of these mechanisms.

61
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:14,580
But the internet that had none of the mechanisms,
and newspapers that no longer have the mechanisms,

62
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:18,760
are now producing truth on a relatively equal basis.

63
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:23,140
Every now and then, some blogger uncovers
some incredible story that nobody’s noticed;

64
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:26,680
it is the truth and the news networks pick it up.

65
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:34,880
Every now and then, the traditional institutions
fall flat on their faces and deliver bullshit to us,

66
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,480
packaged in a fancy name.

67
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:44,639
People start questioning whether they should
believe anything. What is the other option?

68
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,650
Where do you go from here? 
Must you evaluate every fact for yourself?

69
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:55,500
Do you have to build into your critical thinking
the fact-checking department that they fired?

70
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:03,420
How do you go about evaluating every 
piece of knowledge as fact or fake news?

71
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:08,440
Well, there is one easy heuristic...

72
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:14,140
If the esteemed leader of your political party
says it is fake news, then it is fake news.

73
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:19,760
Now we outsource fact-finding
to the tribe that we belong to.

74
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:30,340
If the tribal leader says those guys are lying,
we just go along with it. This happens in Bitcoin, too.

75
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:35,540
Tribalism is part of the human nature.

76
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:45,100
What has just happened in news, leaving an entire
generation unable to discern truth from fiction...

77
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:57,400
and easily manipulated by propaganda -- I'm about
to suggest today that this [will] happen to money.

78
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:02,360
This is about to happen to money. 
How do you know if money is valuable?

79
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,140
I am asked this question every time
I do a seminar about bitcoin,

80
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,160
especially if there are new people in the audience.

81
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:12,340
They say, “But bitcoin isn’t backed by anything."

82
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:19,530
"[Whereas this piece of paper] I have in my pocket says
[it is backed by the] 'Central Bank of Blah Blah.'"

83
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:27,210
It is backed by "the nation" / "the Queen" / "the King"
/ "the Parliament" / "the GDP of my country"...

84
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:30,920
or "the gold that we have in our vaults.”

85
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:37,280
You don’t have any gold in your vaults! [Laughter] 
They still think there is gold in the vaults.

86
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,280
Many people do. It is a common misconception.

87
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:50,200
Most of our understanding of money comes from myth. 
It is just barely removed from the level of Santa Claus.

88
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:56,240
We have this constructed fantasy about 
money that we received as children.

89
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:05,250
As adults, when we notice inconsistencies, we shore it
up with some rusty nails and planks to keep it in place.

90
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,040
We try to keep the illusion.

91
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:16,600
As part of that, we adopt these preposterous
ideas such as, “Oh, there is gold in the vaults."

92
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:21,940
"It kind of works, I don't know... Go make your room,
don't ask me any more questions, honey."

93
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:26,980
I don't understand money either.”

94
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:38,160
We had a heuristic: if a stable democratic government based on some broadly free principles...

95
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,950
sanely manages the economy --
if they say it has value, then it has value.

96
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,520
That’s a great heuristic.

97
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:50,540
That removes the necessity for us to independently
evaluate every note that comes into our hands.

98
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:54,460
Will this [note] still be worth $20 tomorrow?

99
00:10:54,460 --> 00:11:04,900
Okay, not this one because it was counterfeit,
but this other 'real' one? Yeah, it will be worth $20.

100
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:11,220
Maybe it won't buy you $20 worth in today's money;
maybe it will buy you $19.80 [worth of goods] in a year.

101
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:20,040
You don’t really notice that, it is okay. 
You trust that it will still be there...

102
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:29,160
Unless you’re Greek. Or Cyprian. Or Venezuelan. 
Or Argentinian. Or Brazilian. Or from Zimbabwe.

103
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:36,880
Or from the Ukraine. Just keep adding to 
that list, it has happened so many times.

104
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:42,560
One day, you wake up and you
discover the banks are closed.

105
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:49,160
The bank governor is on TV and they say, 
“People, don’t panic! Everything is under control!”

106
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:58,520
When a government official says that, you know... panic!
[Laughter] That is the time to panic.

107
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:04,460
It is about who is first to line up in front of the bank.
They will not open again next week as they promised.

108
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:08,880
The temporary emergency measure 
becomes a permanent emergency measure.

109
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:14,100
Guaranteed, every time. So line up
and run for your money in the bank.

110
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:20,680
Suddenly, the institution of money
has crumbled. Now what do you trust?

111
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:27,640
You go back to basics, things you can examine
and validate for yourself: gold, chicken, rice, salt,

112
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:31,540
sugar, whatever you can get your hands on.

113
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:38,860
Or that other country’s money. 
The U.S. dollar is hard currency, right?

114
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:46,020
Money is one of those things that primarily 
holds value because we attribute [value to it]

115
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:49,920
as a direct result of its issuance by a trusted authority.

116
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:55,860
We outsource our own determination
of value to this trusted third-party.

117
00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:02,180
What happens when that trusted third-party
stops delivering on that promise?

118
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:07,400
On purpose? By accident? 
Through mismanagement? Who knows?

119
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:22,460
But one day, that phrase which seemed
so meaningful and strong and satisfying...

120
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:35,780
"The full faith and credit of the United 
States government." America! [Laughter]

121
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:44,820
"The full faith" -- not just 'some' of the faith --
and credit of the entire United States of America!

122
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:58,130
Satisfying! Okay, compare it to this one: "The full faith
and credit... of the national bank of Zimbabwe!"

123
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:02,700
Do you cry? Do you laugh? Do you run? 
What do you do at that point?

124
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:10,220
That sentence no longer has much weight 
to it, that thing that you put all your faith in.

125
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:17,660
They give you their full faith and credit,
and in return you give your full faith and credit.

126
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:23,620
Every time you receive one of those bills,
you are giving credit.

127
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:27,960
You are giving them a product or a service
in return for the bill -- that's credit.

128
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,880
You are giving faith, your full faith and credit.

129
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:37,400
Your full faith and credit is based on absolutely no
rational thinking, other than you somehow believe...

130
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:42,320
in [these worlds] printed on it: “The full faith and credit.”

131
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:49,140
I have a prediction. This sentence will become
increasingly untenable; not just in the hotspots,

132
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:55,720
not just in the backwaters, not just in developing nations
and the 'Third Worlds' as we used to call them,

133
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,760
but in many places simultaneously.

134
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:08,100
That $220 trillion dollars of debt says “the full faith
and credit” is ringing hollow all around the world.

135
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:13,980
What happens when they can no longer shore it up?

136
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:27,420
Bitcoin is not going after replacing national currencies. 
Oh no, it is doing something far more dangerous.

137
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:33,420
[Bitcoin] is encouraging people to
put their savings outside the system.

138
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:38,200
That is the worst thing you can do to a system
based on full faith and credit.

139
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:50,140
We’re taking away the faith by presenting
an alternative that people will find more useful.

140
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:55,720
In some places, where the full faith and credit
of the national currency has been damaged,

141
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:05,000
they will flock to bitcoin as a valuable alternative,
because they know that it is safer.

142
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:25,040
We saw it happen after November 8th in India,
when Modi demonetized 86% of the country’s money.

143
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,760
Where is the faith now? No full faith.

144
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:36,000
Can you print on the money “the 14% faith
and credit of the National Bank of India”?

145
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,060
[They] took out 86%, so that leaves 14%.

146
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:47,520
"This money is backed by the 14% faith and credit of
the National Bank of India." Doesn’t sound so good.

147
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,420
People flocked to bitcoin.

148
00:16:50,420 --> 00:17:03,600
Just as it wasn’t bloggers challenging the truth of news
that created this dichotomy of fake news,

149
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:13,360
it wasn’t better news gathering that undermined the
newspapers, it was undermining advertising revenue.

150
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:20,660
Cutting off their feed, cutting them off at the knees,
forcing them to adjust their news gathering...

151
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:24,360
to the new level of income they had.

152
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:28,320
What happens when Bitcoin does that to banks?

153
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:36,760
Because when they say "close all the doors and keep
the money in," there is one door they can't close: bitcoin.

154
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:44,420
The money keeps leaking and leaking.
They say, "Put the Minister on television!"

155
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:52,020
"Tell them everything will be fine. 
The yuan will not be devalued any further!"

156
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:59,280
"The full faith and credit of the People’s
Bank of China is behind this currency!"

157
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:05,760
Then a month later, it is devalued another half percent. 
That has happened eight times in the past year.

158
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:11,429
At some point, you [realize], “That [excuse] doesn’t
count any more. I am taking my money elsewhere.”

159
00:18:11,429 --> 00:18:18,580
A few people do. A trickle of billions of 
dollars has fled into bitcoin from the yuan.

160
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:25,740
The damage that is doing is not in offering 
a better way for Chinese people to buy things,

161
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:29,660
to invest in companies, to transact with each other.

162
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:38,200
It is undercutting the very source of revenue,
value, and stability of a national currency...

163
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:42,840
by removing "the full faith and credit" of the people
and putting it into an alternative currency.

164
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:47,440
Instead of putting their savings in a deposit account,

165
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:54,180
where it becomes the basis for fractional reserve
lending, they are sucking liquidity out of the economy.

166
00:18:54,180 --> 00:19:04,940
That is the worst thing you can do with an
economy like that. What will they do next?

167
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:12,880
What the hell can do they now? 
Drag the finance minister on TV.

168
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:24,340
"Dear citizens... drug dealers! Terrorists! 
Pornographers! Criminals! And most importantly...

169
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:29,020
those really nasty people who
live in the country next door!"

170
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:40,200
"They are undermining our nation through 
this fake currency! Bitcoin is fake money!"

171
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:48,140
"They are in a criminal conspiracy to 
damage our economy! Don’t trust it."

172
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:56,700
"Don't invest your money in bitcoin. It is fake money. 
It is backed by nothing! Fake money! Fake money!"

173
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:03,299
"Fake money!" they cry, and scream, and protest. 
"Fake money!" You think that is not happening?

174
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:12,740
It is happening right now. Watch or translate what
Venezuelans said about bitcoin just a few months ago.

175
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:22,460
"Fake money!" In fact, they said,
“It’s the Colombians doing it!” [Laughter]

176
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:29,060
["The enemy"] is always the weirdos next 
door who speak with a funny accent.

177
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:35,020
Soft tacos instead of hard tacos. Abomination!

178
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:39,960
And so the cry starts, slowly at first:
"Fake money, fake money, fake money!"

179
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:46,720
Bitcoin is considered fake money in a few places in the
world. Where do you think it is considered fake money?

180
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:52,560
Not here. Nobody has [really] called bitcoin "fake money"
here, certainly no [government] official did that.

181
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,639
They would [prefer that] it remains in obscurity.

182
00:20:55,639 --> 00:21:02,820
But in Venezuela, bitcoin is "fake money." In Zimbabwe,
bitcoin is "fake money" and they write articles about it.

183
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:09,440
In China, they have tried it a few times;
it hasn’t played very well with the audience.

184
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:18,360
In the absence of institutional authority, there is no
basis for evaluating whether money is real or not.

185
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:27,280
Or is there? What is fake money and real money? 
Who knows? Are we back in the same conundrum?

186
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,600
Are we back in the same situation,
where we can no longer tell the difference?

187
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:36,620
Is this just like fake news?
[Must] we all discover the truth for ourselves?

188
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:47,580
No, because money has markets and markets
discover truth. That is what a [free] market does.

189
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:55,740
If you want to know if bitcoin is fake money,
if the bolivar is fake money, you have an easy test.

190
00:21:55,740 --> 00:22:00,620
You take your bitcoin, you take your bolivar,
and bring them to someone on the street [in India].

191
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:04,620
Ask them, “How much will you give me for this?”

192
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:11,600
If the official exchange rate for the bolivar is
five times less than the unofficial exchange rate,

193
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:23,000
and if bitcoin carries a 20% premium [to buy],
the market is telling you exactly which money is fake.

194
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,820
The market discovers truth.

195
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:31,760
No matter how many pronouncements, 
currency controls, bank bans, bank holidays,

196
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,200
and demonetization incidents you do...

197
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:42,100
No matter how big you try to make that wall, once the
dam has a pin prick hole and water is flowing through,

198
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:45,760
it will make that hole bigger and the truth will come out.

199
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:51,620
The truth will be evaluated by the market.
You can call bitcoin "fake money."

200
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:59,020
The market will say, “Well, I would rather take
that fake money than your fake money.”

201
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:11,260
On November 8th in India, the price of bitcoin went up
and maintained a 22% premium against the rupee...

202
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:15,280
over any other currency in the world.

203
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:27,420
I was asked when I went to India,
“Why is bitcoin so expensive here?

204
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:34,460
Are the exchanges making obscene profits?
No, they’re not. They’re not allowed to do arbitrage.

205
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:41,740
Individuals are doing the arbitrage. 
I explained, “It is not bitcoin that is expensive."

206
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:47,680
If I go down the street with
U.S. dollars and [try to] buy bitcoin,

207
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:51,580
the price [will be about the same]
as what I can get in San Francisco.

208
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:57,360
Bitcoin’s price is exactly the same. But if I give
them rupees, they will want 20% more rupees.

209
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:02,400
It is not bitcoin’s price that went up
-- it is the rupee discount that went up.

210
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,260
The rupee price collapsed by 22%.

211
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:11,720
Bitcoin can be moved across borders to settle the
arbitrage difference, but then you are stuck with rupees.

212
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:23,740
You can’t move them, [which] immediately imposes
a 22% discount because that money is not portable.

213
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:29,720
'Portable' is one of the three characteristics of
what makes it currency. You just lost one of them.

214
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:34,880
Actually two, because you demonetized most of it.

215
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:41,400
Rupees are trading at a discount against bitcoin.
Bitcoin is the stable price.

216
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:54,300
The market is telling you, 'This [money] is more real than
that [money].' The market discovers truth and it tells us.

217
00:24:54,300 --> 00:25:02,840
Be ready. We will start hearing this again and again
as economies collapse, as currencies go into crisis.

218
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:06,900
It is happening even in developed nations.
It is happening in the European Union.

219
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:14,640
It could happen here in the U.S. dollar, who knows? 
The markets are trying to correct the situation.

220
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,740
They will create a flow of money into bitcoin.

221
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:24,640
People will remove their "full faith and credit" from
the system, put [their savings] in safe-haven assets:

222
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,520
gold, silver, bitcoin, etc.

223
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:35,240
As soon as that happens, you will
see articles in the the news media.

224
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:39,680
The fake news telling you about the "fake money."

225
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:52,580
Maybe you can’t tell what is "fake news" and what
isn’t "fake news," but you can tell what isn't real money.

226
00:25:52,580 --> 00:26:00,280
The easiest way to find out, is to go out on the street
and ask the market. The market will tell you the truth.

227
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:05,700
Thank you. [Applause]
