00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,720
[IRVING GERSTEIN] Last week, the committee returned
to hearing [from] witnesses directly involved with...

2
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,440
one of the digital currencies: bitcoin.

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:19,480
The Bitcoin Embassy, the Bitcoin Alliance 
of Canada, and the Bitcoin Foundation.

4
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:24,280
Today we are pleased to welcome
Mr. Andreas Antonopoulos.

5
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:32,280
[He is] considered to be the Bitcoin guru, and was
suggested to us by several previous witnesses.

6
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:38,620
Mr. Antonopoulos is both an entrepreneur 
and an author in the field of Bitcoin.

7
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:43,180
He is a computer science graduate
from the University College London.

8
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:54,080
His expertise includes Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies,
information security, cryptography, cloud computing,

9
00:00:54,080 --> 00:01:01,060
data centers, Linux, open source,
and robotics software development.

10
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:07,600
He has over two hundred articles
published and is syndicated worldwide.

11
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:14,340
In addition, he is a Certified Information Systems
Security Professional (CISSP) for over 12 years,

12
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:21,540
and a permanent host on the "Let's Talk Bitcoin" (LTB)
podcast, which is devoted to [discussing] Bitcoin.

13
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,920
Mr. Antonopoulos is also a prolific public speaker.

14
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,180
He recently appeared at the Toronto 
Bitcoin Expo held earlier this year,

15
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:33,920
which I must tell our committee, our analysts attended.

16
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:42,180
Members of the committee, he has
literally written the book on Bitcoin, entitled:

17
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:46,740
"Mastering Bitcoin: Unlocking Digital Currencies."

18
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:52,220
It is with great pleasure that I turn the floor over
to Mr. Antonopoulos for his opening remarks,

19
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,820
to be followed by your astute questions.

20
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:00,200
Mr. Antonopoulos, welcome! The floor is yours, sir.

21
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,680
[ANDREAS] Thank you, Chair and committee members.

22
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:08,640
I appreciate the opportunity to contribute 
to these proceedings about digital currency.

23
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,360
My [professional] experience is primarily in
information security and network architecture.

24
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:19,580
I have a master's degree in networks and distributed
systems, and have worked in the field since 1992.

25
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:25,300
I spent twenty years working on networks and
data centers for financial services companies...

26
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:29,160
before I found Bitcoin in late 2011.

27
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,480
I have been working full-time in the
Bitcoin space for the past two years,

28
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,380
and written a book on Bitcoin for software developers.

29
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:41,840
Today, I welcome the opportunity to talk to you about
Bitcoin's security, the decentralized architecture...

30
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,580
that underpins Bitcoin's security,
and the implications that architecture has for...

31
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:53,720
privacy, individual empowerment, 
innovation, and regulation.

32
00:02:53,720 --> 00:03:02,960
Until the invention of Bitcoin in 2008, security and
decentralization seemed like [opposing] concepts.

33
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:11,200
Traditional models for financial payment networks and
banking rely on centralized control to provide security.

34
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:18,080
The architecture is built around central 
authorities such as a clearinghouse.

35
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,700
Authority must be vested in that central actor.

36
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,140
The resulting security model looks
like a series of concentric circles,

37
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:33,500
with very limited access to the center, [decreasing
power] as we move further away from the center.

38
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:41,700
Even the most outermost circle cannot 
afford open access in such a security model.

39
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:47,320
The system is carefully protected by controlling access,
ensuring only vetted individuals and organizations...

40
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,840
can connect to it.

41
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:55,620
The entities near the center of the network are vested
with enormous power, act with full authority;

42
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:00,100
therefore, they must be very carefully 
vetted, regulated, and subject to oversight.

43
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:07,980
Centralized financial networks can never be fully open
to innovation. Their security depends on access control.

44
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:13,600
Incumbents in such networks effectively utilize access
control to stifle outside innovation and competition,

45
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,100
presenting their actions as consumer protection.

46
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:22,780
Centralized financial networks are fragile and
require multiple layers of oversight to ensure that...

47
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:27,520
the central actors do not abuse their 
authority and power for their own profit.

48
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,420
Unfortunately, the centralized architecture of
traditional financial systems concentrates power,

49
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:38,900
creating cozy relationships between industry insiders
and regulators, often leading to regulatory capture.

50
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:44,680
[The lack of] oversight leads to corruption,
and in the end, financial crises.

51
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:51,400
Bitcoin, and other digital currencies based on the
blockchain architecture, are fundamentally different.

52
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:57,760
The security model of blockchain currencies is
decentralized. There is no center to the network.

53
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:06,080
No central authority, no concentration of power,
no actor in whom complete trust must be vested.

54
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,500
Instead, the core security functions are put 
in the hands of the end users of the system.

55
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:18,120
In this architecture, security is an emergent property of
the collaboration of thousands of network participants,

56
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,960
and not the function of a single authority.

57
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,240
In addition to the differences in architecture,
there are also fundamental differences...

58
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,480
in the nature of the payments themselves.

59
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:33,980
Digital currencies like bitcoin are much more
like cash than bank accounts or credit cards.

60
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:39,320
The transfer of value in Bitcoin is a
push mechanism, not a pull mechanism...

61
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:44,200
as is the case with credit cards, debit cards,
and most other digital payments.

62
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:48,800
A bitcoin payment is not an authorization 
to pull [funds] from your account;

63
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:55,460
instead, it pushes the precise payment amount
as a value token directly to the [selected] recipient.

64
00:05:55,460 --> 00:06:01,280
A single transaction does not authorize any 
future transaction, or expose the user's identity.

65
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,580
The transaction itself is
unforgeable and unchangeable.

66
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:11,500
As a result, bitcoin payments can be transmitted
in the clear, without encryption, over any network.

67
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:16,560
[Transactions, though not keys], can be stored in
unsecured systems without fear of compromise.

68
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,400
Bitcoin's unique architecture and payment mechanism
has important implications for network access,

69
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:28,560
innovation, privacy, individual empowerment,
consumer protection, and regulation.

70
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:34,160
If a bad actor has access to the Bitcoin network,
they have no power over the network itself,

71
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,060
and can not compromise trust in the network.

72
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:44,300
This means the Bitcoin network can be open to
any participant without vetting, authentication,

73
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,920
identification, or prior authorization.

74
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:54,420
Not only can the network be open to anyone,
but it can also be open to any software application,

75
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:57,940
without prior vetting or authorization.

76
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:04,580
The ability to innovate without permission 
at the edge is the same fundamental force...

77
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:11,160
that has driven internet innovation for twenty years at
a frenetic pace creating enormous value for consumers,

78
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,880
economic growth, opportunities, and jobs.

79
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:21,640
Bitcoin's decentralized nature affords 
consumer protection in the most powerful way,

80
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:28,840
by allowing bitcoin users direct control over 
the privacy of their financial transactions.

81
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:35,600
Bitcoin does not force users to surrender identity
with every transaction or put their trust in a [series]..

82
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,120
of supposedly vetted intermediaries...

83
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:46,040
who must be trusted to securely store and protect
transaction data and vulnerable account identifiers.

84
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:50,160
Bitcoin transactions never expose 
vulnerable account identifiers.

85
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:57,720
Bitcoin users can protect the privacy of their
transactions without relying on any intermediaries.

86
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:04,640
In Bitcoin, trust is not vested in central actors, so there
is no need for centralized regulation and oversight.

87
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:10,720
When properly architected, Bitcoin financial services
are not vulnerable to central points of failure,

88
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,220
which would necessitate
heavy-handed oversight and regulation.

89
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:20,900
Instead, power lies with the end user, whose interests
are most aligned with the protection of their own funds.

90
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:26,420
While individual bitcoin wallets can be targeted
and compromised if not properly secured,

91
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:31,940
the network does not suffer
from centralized systemic risks.

92
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:36,800
Contrary to popular misconception,
Bitcoin is not unregulated.

93
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,000
Rather, several aspects of the
Bitcoin network and financial system...

94
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,060
are regulated by mathematical algorithms.

95
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:50,600
The algorithmic regulation in Bitcoin offers
predictable, objective, measurable outcomes,

96
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,180
such as a predictable rate of currency issuance.

97
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:58,680
These outcomes are not subject to the whims
of centralized institutions or committees,

98
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:03,120
which are both corruptible and often 
placed outside of democratic oversight.

99
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,420
A bitcoin user can predict the monetary 
supply thirty years from now, instead of...

100
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:14,060
hanging on the nuanced intonation of a single
adjective by some high official of central banking...

101
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:20,060
who can dramatically change an entire 
country's monetary velocity a week hence.

102
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:24,600
Bitcoin's decentralized architecture does 
not easily conform to the expectations...

103
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,140
or experiences of consumers and regulators.

104
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:33,060
Because there has never been a large-scale,
secure, decentralized network before.

105
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:39,060
The combination of decentralization and 
security is the novelty at the heart of Bitcoin.

106
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:44,420
In trying to understand [how] consumer protection,
oversight, audits, and regulation [apply to] Bitcoin,

107
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:49,900
there is a risk that many will try to apply familiar models
of the past to this new digital currency system.

108
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:57,020
These models, designed to provide regulation
and oversight of centralized financial networks,

109
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:59,320
will seem familiar and be easier to understand.

110
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:06,440
However, they are inefficient and unsuitable for
this new form of decentralized financial network.

111
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:11,900
I urge you to resist the temptation to apply 
centralized solutions to this decentralized network.

112
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:18,820
Centralizing Bitcoin [would] weaken its security, dull
innovative potential, and remove its most disruptive...

113
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,400
yet also most promising features.

114
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:25,540
Centralization will disempower users
while empowering incumbents.

115
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:30,900
Consumer protection will not be achieved by
removing Bitcoin's built-in privacy characteristics.

116
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:37,740
Demanding user identifiers, adding access control
mechanisms, and then trusting those identifiers...

117
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:42,320
to a chain of intermediaries, will only 
replicate the failures of the past.

118
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,580
[This would] introduce single points of 
failure into a network that has none.

119
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:51,140
We cannot protect consumers by removing 
their ability to control their own privacy,

120
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:56,740
then asking them to entrust it in the same intermediaries
who have failed them so many times before.

121
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:01,580
Most failures in Bitcoin's security are the result
of misguided attempts at centralization,

122
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,460
such as removing control from the users.

123
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:11,020
In this new decentralized financial network, we have
the opportunity to invent new security mechanisms...

124
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:17,740
based upon innovations such as multi-signature
escrow, smart contracts, hardware wallets,

125
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:22,480
decentralized audits, and algorithmic proof of reserves.

126
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,580
These are the new decentralized regulatory 
and security tools that are most appropriate...

127
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:30,280
for a decentralized digital currency.

128
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:33,500
Thank you for the opportunity
to address this committee.

129
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:39,100
[IRVING GERSTEIN] Thank you, Mr. Antonopoulos for
your opening remarks. They have clearly resonated...

130
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,140
and stimulated a number of questions.

131
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:48,020
But before I turn it over to senators for questions,
[first] I just might make an observation.

132
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:56,600
In your remarks, you have told the committee that the
decentralized security model of blockchain currencies...

133
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:04,280
is indeed secure, and that Bitcoin financial services
are not vulnerable to central points of failure which...

134
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,700
would necessitate oversight and regulation.

135
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:13,260
As a result, as I hear you, you have come to the
conclusion that this currency should be left...

136
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:16,660
hands-off by the government
and other regulatory bodies.

137
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:23,100
I quote, "Centralizing Bitcoin will weaken its security."

138
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:28,620
While listening very closely to your comments,
I couldn't help but observe that you made...

139
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:35,360
absolutely no mention of illegal activity 
supporting a cryptocurrency like bitcoin.

140
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,760
I was surprised that you make no mention 
of money laundering, terrorist financing,

141
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:47,540
or other possible misuses because of
the anonymous and open nature of Bitcoin.

142
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:58,540
I think you stated in your presentation that the Bitcoin
network can be open to any participant without vetting,

143
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:04,700
authentication, identification, or prior authorization.

144
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:12,760
I suspect that the misuse or potential misuse of bitcoin
for nefarious purposes is very much a concern...

145
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,680
to Canadians, as well as to this committee.

146
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,660
Would you have any comments on that?

147
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:22,280
Perhaps it may be picked up by some
of the senators in their questions as well.

148
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,680
[ANDREAS] Absolutely.

149
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:29,660
I believe there is a great misconception
in the idea that bitcoin use is anonymous,

150
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:32,420
or that the network itself is anonymous.

151
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:40,920
On the contrary, the public ledger allows any participants
to observe all transactions that occur on the network.

152
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,620
Those transactions are not tied to a specific identity,

153
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:52,460
but with the use of traditional law enforcement
mechanisms, when an identity is attached to...

154
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:56,820
a specific transaction, [those funds]
can be followed throughout the network.

155
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:00,180
Therefore, the network does not afford more anonymity.

156
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:06,180
In fact, it is easier to implement strong 
transparency and accountability features...

157
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:10,900
than it is to achieve anonymity on the network.

158
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:16,380
Furthermore, I think bitcoin is not a
very convenient network for such uses.

159
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:21,140
The vast majority of such activities
really occur with cash, with the U.S. dollar.

160
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:28,140
I don't see bitcoin as the primary vehicle
for illicit activities of that type.

161
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:35,080
I see tremendous potential for the use of bitcoin
among the more than six billion people in the world...

162
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:40,840
who have very limited [or no] access to 
international currencies, credit markets, and trade.

163
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:48,840
I think that use far outweighs the tiny minority
who might put such currencies to illicit use.

164
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:53,640
[IRVING GERSTEIN] Well, thank you for those
comments. With that, I will start with my list.

165
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:58,220
[Mixed discussion] [Laughter]

166
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:02,260
[IRVING GERSTEIN] When it is his turn,
we will turn it over to him for that.

167
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:07,120
Senator Black, to be followed by Senator Campbell.

168
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,480
[DOUGLAS BLACK] Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you very much, Mr. Antonopoulos...

169
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:16,620
[Interruption]
[IRVING GERSTEIN] Senator, please. Order.

170
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,600
[DOUGLAS BLACK] Thank you very much, 
Mr. Antonopoulos, for being here.

171
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,780
I'm finding very real interest in what you have to say.

172
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:29,940
First of all, let me outline what I am
hoping to come to understand from you.

173
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:37,980
I'm interested in learning what is needed to 
ensure that this innovation can continue to develop.

174
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,700
So that is my premise, right or wrong.

175
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:47,920
Building on the Chairman's initial comments,
I do have a question or two for you.

176
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,600
When CA Vertex testified before this committee,

177
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,580
they stated that they would like to see Bitcoin
regulations put in place as soon as possible,

178
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:00,500
to give clarity on how Bitcoin is classified.

179
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:05,260
They believe, and told this committee, that 
this would allow Bitcoin to thrive in Canada.

180
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:12,680
In your remarks, you stated that Bitcoin should not
be regulated centrally because it will stifle innovation.

181
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:17,840
Considering that other groups have
echoed the statements of CA Vertex,

182
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:24,940
help me with a disconnect I'm hearing between the
evidence of CA Vertex and what you have said today.

183
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:31,660
[ANDREAS] Absolutely. I believe that the 
best way to help Bitcoin is to ensure that...

184
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:35,120
there is clarity in the treatment of Bitcoin,

185
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:44,260
so that Bitcoin is not forced to contorting itself
into regulator structures that are designed...

186
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:50,660
by banks, for banks, [in the mind of] traditional
models of finance which are primarily centralized.

187
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:55,320
[It must be recognized] that bitcoin, as 
programmable money, with capabilities...

188
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:59,120
such as digital multi-signature escrow,

189
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:05,520
has many more flexible ways of responding 
to the need for consumer protection.

190
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:10,300
For example, in the traditional banking environment,

191
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:16,420
unless you hold cash, every account you have
as a consumer is a custodial account.

192
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:21,000
That means the funds are held in trust by a bank.

193
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,560
What you have in return is essentially a promise note
that the money will still be there tomorrow morning.

194
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:30,080
The bank controls the funds entirely.

195
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:40,080
Bitcoin allows for a more varied range of control
between consumers and financial services institutions,

196
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:48,400
from decentralized control, where the consumer or
end-user is the only one with full control over the money,

197
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:54,680
to complete custodial accounts, where a financial
services institution has full access to the keys,

198
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,740
while the consumer has none.

199
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:01,420
In between, there are also hybrid models.

200
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:07,800
The bank may have a signatory role, but would
not be able to change the direction of the funds.

201
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,260
They simply [sign] to approve transactions.

202
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:19,840
Within this very broad range of possibilities,
obviously some aspects of that do need regulation.

203
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:29,500
If you simulate a traditional financial environment with
custodial accounts and take full control of user funds,

204
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,640
then those funds are now outside
of the Bitcoin security model.

205
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:41,860
They are no longer protected by [decentralized]
control of keys in blockchain [security model].

206
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:48,720
Those [funds] are now in a gray area, not covered
by regulatory requirements for capital adequacy,

207
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,220
audits, and security controls, etc.

208
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:56,480
They are also not covered by the Bitcoin security model.

209
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,600
We have seen that whenever that
has happened, it results in disaster.

210
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:07,020
All of the exchanges that have been attacked
in Bitcoin had a full custodial model like that.

211
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,620
However, that is not the only model that exists.

212
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:16,100
There are digital bitcoin wallets
where the user has complete control.

213
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,740
There are wallets where the user has complete control,

214
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:23,640
but transactions cannot happen unless an additional
signature is placed by [another party or] institution...

215
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:29,320
that acts essentially as a risk manager, to ensure
that even if the user's system is compromised,

216
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:32,260
the money can't be stolen. A hybrid model.

217
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:37,200
If you lump all of those [models] together 
under a single unifying [regulatory policy],

218
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:43,820
assuming that it is all just like a bank, then you will
miss out on opportunities to create better solutions...

219
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:47,080
with this new programmable money.

220
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:56,120
I do believe that certain models of bitcoin use must
be regulated, if control over user funds is centralized.

221
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,340
That institution puts consumers at risk.

222
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:04,840
But to lump in a decentralized model where 
the user still has full control over their funds,

223
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,740
[maybe with] an institution which can't steal their money,

224
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:15,080
that same regulation is not only misguided, but it doesn't
leave any room for the technology to develop further.

225
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,920
[DOUGLAS BLACK] May I ask one further question?
Thank you very much for that.

226
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:27,120
What would you suggest to this committee 
in terms of regulation [for Bitcoin], if any?

227
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:32,880
[ANDREAS] I believe, we are still at
the very early stages of this technology.

228
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,440
Not only is Bitcoin new, but Bitcoin is already evolving.

229
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:46,620
For example, the capability to do a multi-signature
transaction with up to twenty different signatories.

230
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,700
A transaction can be controlled
by a mixture of signatures.

231
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:54,400
That [scheme] was introduced in 2012,
four years after the introduction of Bitcoin.

232
00:20:54,400 --> 00:21:06,520
[That became] available in 2013, so Bitcoin is already
developing new, exciting programmable capabilities...

233
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,240
for user security.

234
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,540
I think this technology needs time to breathe.

235
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:18,980
It needs time to show the full potential of what is =
possible with decentralized programmable money.

236
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:27,780
Until that time, I think [we can] open up those
possibilities by making clear distinctions...

237
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:33,560
where the technology allows it, for example between
centralized and decentralized modes of operation,

238
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:42,420
and understanding those nuances, can create niches for
new players to come in to the financial services market.

239
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:48,640
[This will] introduce innovation, competition,
and disruption into the banking industry...

240
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,100
by trying out new models for consumer protection,

241
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:55,580
which in my opinion are superior
to the ones we have today.

242
00:21:55,580 --> 00:22:03,500
[DOUGLAS BLACK] So your answer is what,
in terms of what this committee should do, if anything?

243
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:09,100
[ANDREAS] Wait until the technology
is better understood by all of us.

244
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:14,720
Understand that there are nuances
that require very careful treatment.

245
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:21,840
[Not] a blanket treatment that this is just a currency,
which it is not. It is a network for money.

246
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:26,440
[Not] a treatment as if there is only one 
application, the bitcoin currency, which it is not.

247
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,840
There are many applications based on this model.

248
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,920
[A blanket treatment] would stifle
this technology in its early days.

249
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,680
[DOUGLAS BLACK] Thank you very much. Mr. Chairman.
[IRVING GERSTEIN] Thank you, Senator Black.

250
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:38,180
Senator Campbell, to be followed by Senator Greene.

251
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:43,540
[LARRY CAMPBELL] Thank you, Chair.
And thank you so much for coming today.

252
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:52,820
I remember when I got an IBM Selectric that
had a backspace so that I could correct letters.

253
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:58,180
And I thought, 'Nothing will ever be cooler 
than this. It's impossible.' [Laughter]

254
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:03,500
I am 67 years old. That is my generation.

255
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:09,240
Would it be fair- You say it needs some breathing space.

256
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:20,400
Would it be fair to say that the younger generation
[understands Bitcoin] more so than my generation?

257
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,740
[ANDREAS] With any new technology,
I think that is the case.

258
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:28,440
[LARRY CAMPBELL] Do you think it is fair to say-
For instance, I would doubt very much that I will...

259
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:35,040
get into bitcoins, because I don't really understand it
even though we are on our 11th meeting. [Laughter]

260
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:39,900
[UNKNOWN] We are lucky that Paul does.
[LARRY CAMPBELL] Yes, Senator Massicotte does.

261
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:49,240
But when I talk to younger people about this committee,
they totally get it and don't have any questions at all.

262
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:57,880
They say, "This is where we are going and how we will
get there." I've been told to keep my old nose out of it.

263
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:05,520
[Laughter] I think you explained it.
How much time does it take for this to breathe?

264
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:10,500
How long do you think that would be?
I mean, how rapid will this come upon us?

265
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:17,020
[ANDREAS] I would estimate that Bitcoin today,
is approximately [where] the internet was in 1992.

266
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:23,740
In 1992, when I used email, that required 
command line Unix skills, typed into a mainframe.

267
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:34,200
It was very difficult. Approximately ten years [later],
it had already reached mainstream adoption...

268
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,000
especially among younger people.

269
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:42,920
Almost exactly twenty years [later], my mother got
her first iPad and was able to send her first email.

270
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:46,799
It took some while until the technology 
went from something extremely esoteric,

271
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:50,980
only the purview of someone working
in a computer science department,

272
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:56,340
until my mother could do it with a swipe of her finger,
and she is a self-acknowledged technophobe.

273
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,200
So [Bitcoin] may take some time [too].

274
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:03,140
What I can tell you, for sure, is that
it will [happen] about three times faster.

275
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:07,560
Because we are [mostly] not deploying physical
infrastructure and already have the internet...

276
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:10,940
as a medium on which we can spread this,

277
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:16,540
I believe we will see very mainstream 
applications with eight years that will be...

278
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:18,660
much easier to use and secure.

279
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:25,620
[These applications] will allow consumers to
use bitcoin in a way that feels very comfortable.

280
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:29,000
At the moment, we are not there.

281
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,120
[LARRY CAMPBELL] Okay, just one more question.

282
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:44,800
The question I have is, if you don't need any 
centralized oversight, who provides it [in Bitcoin]?

283
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:53,740
I mean, you say the end-user controls the whole thing.

284
00:25:53,740 --> 00:26:08,180
If there is nobody finding out who the end-user is, how
can we be sure that ISIS or another whack-job crew...

285
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:14,700
[won't] use this as a method of
transferring money around the world?

286
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:21,560
[ANDREAS] I firmly believe that the possibility
for positive uses of this technology far outweighs...

287
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:25,780
the very small possibility for negative uses.

288
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:33,960
The truth is, ISIS is probably using pallets of money
that they stole from [the United States and its] allies...

289
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:38,780
during their reign of terror, and not bitcoin.

290
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:48,680
I think it is a matter of understanding that limiting
technology which has the [potential] to bring...

291
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:52,940
economic inclusion to billions
of people who do not have it today,

292
00:26:52,940 --> 00:27:04,780
in the same way that cellphones allowed entire nations
to leapfrog the landlines and achieve communication...

293
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:06,880
that would be unthinkable
[in prior realms of technology],

294
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,220
Bitcoin can do the same for banking and finance.

295
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:16,120
It can empower billions of people around 
the world in areas such as remittances,

296
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:22,840
accessing international finance, credit, 
liquidity, loans, and things like that.

297
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:34,600
As with any technology, this technology will reflect
society, with a tiny minority who may use it for evil.

298
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:43,500
I have full faith that the law enforcement capabilities,
properly exercised, could follow funds on Bitcoin,

299
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:50,660
just as they can in the traditional
financial networks, and probably more so.

300
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:56,860
Furthermore, I think bitcoin is the most 
open and transparent of cryptocurrencies.

301
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:59,380
There are already about five hundred others.

302
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:10,820
I believe that if Bitcoin is not given the opportunity
to work in a way that empowers people,

303
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:19,440
eventually [any] criminals will move to far more stealthy
and less open currencies, and use those instead.

304
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:24,080
[LARRY CAMPBELL] Thank you. Thank you very much
for coming today. I very much appreciate it.

305
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,980
[IRVING GERSTEIN] Thank you, Senator Campbell.
Senator Greene, to be followed by Senator Massicotte.

306
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:31,780
[STEPHEN GREENE] Thank you very much for coming.

307
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:37,120
Without question, this is the most 
interesting topic we have looked at...

308
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,640
since I have been a member of the committee.

309
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,260
I am just amazed by-

310
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:47,960
One of the things I was thinking about 
last night as I was reading your paper,

311
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:53,120
the idea that occurred to me,
and I want you to comment on it,

312
00:28:53,120 --> 00:29:03,840
is that bitcoin and related currencies are not
hackable, because there is nothing to hack.

313
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:13,300
Is that a true statement? I wonder, if it is, 
could explain that in very simple terms?

314
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:18,520
Because I imagine there are
a lot of people watching this.

315
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:23,080
[ANDREAS] Individual bitcoin wallets,
such as my wallet, can be hacked.

316
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:28,540
We see examples of that [happening].
But the system as a whole cannot be hacked.

317
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:36,080
I say that with confidence because, over the last five
years, especially recently in the last year and a half,

318
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:41,820
the value transferred over the Bitcoin network
[in that time] exceeded $5 billion U.S. dollars.

319
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:45,620
There has been no shortage
of people trying to hack Bitcoin.

320
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:53,720
If anything, Bitcoin has changed the
dynamics of cybercrime and hacking.

321
00:29:53,720 --> 00:30:02,180
The attacks have escalated. Bitcoin created
a target for hackers that is extremely fluid,

322
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:05,000
residing on [many] people's computers.

323
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,120
They have tried to take advantage of that.

324
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:12,580
But I know that Bitcoin [as a system] can't be hacked,
simply because many people have been trying...

325
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:15,940
non-stop for the past five years and can't hack it.

326
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:25,420
There is a very big difference between the system
as a whole, which is dynamic and responds to attacks,

327
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,700
and individual wallets.

328
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:32,680
I think you will see a very similar 
development timeline as with the internet.

329
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:39,840
I remember a time when groups of hackers could
take down Yahoo, Microsoft, and Google for a day.

330
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,880
They don't do that anymore,
but not because they stopped trying.

331
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:54,340
A dynamic system that is constantly exposed
to threatening stimuli will develop resistance...

332
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:56,340
to these types of attacks.

333
00:30:56,340 --> 00:31:03,000
This is a concept often called "anti-fragility."
It becomes dynamically stable and resistant to attack.

334
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:09,820
Bitcoin is not static. It continuously evolves,
dealing with attacks better and better over time.

335
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,960
[STEPHEN GREENE] Thanks very much, very interesting.

336
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:17,700
You mentioned in the answer to the previous question...

337
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:26,120
that there are roughly five hundred other
cryptocurrencies. [ANDREAS] Mm-hmm.

338
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:34,780
[STEPHEN GREENE] What is the size of Bitcoin
in relation to those? Are they major competitors?

339
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:38,380
Or are they copy-cats?

340
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:42,040
[ANDREAS] I would say, for the most part,
that they are just copy-cats.

341
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:48,440
My personal opinion is that the
allocation of cryptocurrencies...

342
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:55,860
(in terms of market size, adoption by users, etc.) 
follows a long-tail or power-law distribution curve,

343
00:31:55,860 --> 00:32:01,400
where the vast majority is concentrated in 
one or maybe a [small] handful of currencies,

344
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:07,500
and then you potentially have a tail that stretches out
to encompass thousands of smaller currencies.

345
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:14,700
Being able to [start] currencies at whim creates
an environment where there will be thousands...

346
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:25,060
possibly tens of thousands of currencies in the future,
but only a handful have economic viability, market value.

347
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:28,540
That doesn't change the [potential], in my opinion,

348
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:33,460
for people to create currencies
the way they create internet memes.

349
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:40,520
In many cases, they will be internet memes.
We have seen that happen in [crypto]currencies.

350
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:49,140
What is happening here is a laboratory of [technological]
evolution and innovation, where new ideas are tested.

351
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:58,540
Some of the best results are often catastrophic failure
on a small scale that informs future designs for Bitcoin.

352
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:08,640
[STEPHEN GREENE] It's amazing. Do you foresee a
time when, in the interests of economic development..

353
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:19,620
what-have-you, that a nation state [would] decide
to forgo its own currency and adopt bitcoin?

354
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:25,700
[ANDREAS] That is a difficult question.
I think the very nature of currency is changing.

355
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:34,660
The economy, or 'organization' if you like, 
adopting the bitcoin currency is the internet.

356
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:36,860
That is a transnational entity.

357
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:41,800
I think that has even more important implications
for the future than national currencies.

358
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:46,380
Bitcoin is already bigger than some national currencies;

359
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:54,020
it may end up being more important for economic
activity than dozens of smaller national currencies.

360
00:33:54,020 --> 00:34:02,380
I do foresee that national central banks 
may utilize blockchain technology to...

361
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:06,460
underpin national digital currencies.

362
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,340
[STEPHEN GREENE] Great. Thank you. 
[IRVING GERSTEIN] Thank you, Senator Greene.

363
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:13,860
Senator Massicotte, to be followed by Senator Wells.

364
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:19,020
[PAUL MASSICOTTE] Thank you, Chair. Thank you for
being with us. It is obviously very interesting and useful.

365
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:22,060
Let me follow up on the question from our Chair.

366
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:30,240
[In] your presentation, you discourage us from
even recommending some form of identification.

367
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:39,620
I think your argument is, [transactions] are always
be visible; you are right, the chain is very visible.

368
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:45,080
But what you don't see in a chain is, who is 
behind the chain. And that is why I would presume...

369
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:49,460
people with illegal objectives
or means are prepared to use it.

370
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:55,880
They apparently are using this mechanism
to transfer and launder money.

371
00:34:55,880 --> 00:35:03,660
I gather your argument is: 'I recognize that is a negative
[use case], but don't hesitate because of that issue.'

372
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:09,640
'Don't put measures in place to restrict that flow,
because the usefulness of those measures in...

373
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:13,620
identifying who is behind the transfers, will 
be less than the usefulness to our society...

374
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:16,940
in letting this thing develop. Is that accurate?

375
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:24,260
The chain is visible, but not the identity of the persons,
which is what I think the Chairman was asking about.

376
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:31,980
[ANDREAS] I am recognizing two aspects: 
[first], attempts at imposing identity on Bitcoin...

377
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:39,920
will be ineffective because there will always be
channels by which non-identifiable transactions...

378
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:44,420
can be introduced, either in Bitcoin or other 
currencies, while simultaneously removing...

379
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:46,080
one of the greatest advantages.

380
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:53,080
Senator, today I have received three automated
phone calls from Visa fraud prevention just because...

381
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,080
I used my card in Canada.

382
00:35:55,080 --> 00:36:01,660
They have been calling me all day. This is something
that happens to me every time I travel.

383
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:08,660
This is a symptom of releasing an identifier 
that allows others to pull from my account...

384
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:13,120
and ties every transaction I [send] to every activity I do.

385
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:20,180
I am not only giving up my privacy, but endangering my
personal financial security every time I use a credit card.

386
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:23,680
This system is non-viable.

387
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:31,140
I watch every few weeks on the news that yet another
[company] has lost fifty million consumer credit cards,

388
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:38,060
or identity [documents] lost; for the average consumer,
that is months of identity protection and risk.

389
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:41,720
These are the intermediaries who handle our identities.

390
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:47,620
Over the last two decades, we have seen that protecting
[centralized] information systems in such a way...

391
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:51,240
that we can prevent these
types of thefts, is not possible.

392
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:54,300
The mistake is tying identity to every transaction,

393
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:58,740
and creating systems that can continuously
draw [money] from our accounts.

394
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:06,080
Bitcoin is fundamentally different. To break that in order
to tie identities, which anyone can easily bypass...

395
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:14,640
if they have [enough] ill intent, would not result
in protecting us more, but harming consumers.

396
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:20,580
[PAUL MASSICOTTE] The conclusion being, you
acknowledge that this system could encourage...

397
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:28,180
money-laundering, but you're arguing to not do anything
about it, because the benefits for society from this...

398
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:30,300
form of transfer is more important.

399
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:33,780
Is that your argument?
I gather that is what you're saying.

400
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:37,080
[ANDREAS] My argument is that, [regardless of]
the invention [and use] of blockchain technologies,

401
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:42,420
any of these systems to be used for
ill intent, with [or without] identity.

402
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:45,580
There is nothing that can be done to stop someone-

403
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:47,400
[PAUL MASSICOTTE] Nor should even try to stop.

404
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:51,620
[ANDREAS] I think that would harm the
vast majority of people who do good with it.

405
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:55,560
[PAUL MASSICOTTE] Let me talk to you about...
We are a little bit older than you are, but...

406
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:59,100
Every time we achieve certain points in life-

407
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:02,300
I guess we could look at central banks 
because we are the banking committee.

408
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:05,540
They come across new theories every 
twenty to thirty years about how to control...

409
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:10,680
money supply, growth, and inflation.

410
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:17,740
Then we always learn thirty or forty years later, 
'Sorry, we got it wrong. Shit happens,' in other words.

411
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:24,260
Having said that, when I look at your algorithm-
You say we will predict the necessary growth...

412
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:28,160
of this currency as a form of transfer, and we got it right.

413
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:32,000
But I highly suspect that twenty to thirty,
I will say, "Well, you didn't get a right."

414
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,620
Clue me in: what would be the one or two things
that you got wrong when you project the future?

415
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:39,780
Where are the one or two
weaknesses where you can say,

416
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:44,680
"I could have been wrong;
here is where I may have gone wrong"?

417
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:52,520
[ANDREAS] What is useful to understand is, Bitcoin's
monetary policy is just one recipe that is possible.

418
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:58,820
Bitcoin and other currencies like that allow us 
to implement monetary recipes at will,

419
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:01,980
and then fix [or replace] them.

420
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:06,880
If Bitcoin's monetary recipe is wrong, 
people will move to another currency...

421
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:12,300
that has the same characteristics of decentralized
organization, but with a different monetary recipe.

422
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:16,040
It is simply one of the possible choices.

423
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,920
I don't know if it is the right or wrong monetary policy,

424
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:27,580
but I do know what Bitcoin's [issuance rate] will be in
thirty years years, down to the millionth decimal point.

425
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:33,340
Exactly how many currency units will exist in 140 years.

426
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:39,500
What it provides, whether you like that recipe or not,
whether you agree with it or not, is certainty.

427
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:45,760
It provides predictability. It allows
people to adjust their expectations.

428
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,280
Whether that is right or wrong monetary policy...

429
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:52,620
Well, with this new model, you can build your own
currency which has a different monetary policy.

430
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:57,000
And if it is better, it [will] win [in the market].
It is an open competition.

431
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,700
[PAUL MASSICOTTE] The supply is defined by
the algorithm. But people like our Chairman...

432
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:05,780
who [could have] bought this unit [of 
currency], maybe the supply is limited,

433
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:09,780
But if [the price] will be equal to the demand
growth, who knows [where the price will go]?

434
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:13,340
[ANDREAS] Nobody knows. [PAUL MASSICOTTE]
The price of that currency may fluctuate immensely...

435
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:15,720
if you got [the monetary policy] wrong.

436
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:19,840
The purpose of the algorithm is to project, 
as reasonable as it can, that future growth.

437
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:24,300
But it may not be.
Maybe the supply is defined, but not the price.

438
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:28,400
Therefore, if you get high fluctuation of value,
that will discourage its use [as a currency].

439
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:33,720
[ANDREAS] Absolutely, but at the moment volatility
is a reflection of very low liquidity in bitcoin.

440
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:42,140
Bitcoin has a very specific recipe that simulates
the supply curve of precious metals like gold.

441
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:46,320
That is a very specific monetary theory.

442
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:51,900
If there is a different monetary theory, you can build
a different currency using blockchain technology.

443
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:56,460
You could even build a blockchain technology
currency where the monetary supply is defined...

444
00:40:56,460 --> 00:41:01,800
by a committee of twelve central bankers,
and then invite users / consumers to adopt it.

445
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,712
It would still be more transparent
than our current system of money.

446
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,540
[PAUL MASSICOTTE] Thank you, Chair.
[IRVING GERSTEIN] Thank you.

447
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:11,660
Senator Wells, to be followed by Senator Ringuette.

448
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:17,200
[DAVID WELLS] Thank you very much, Chair.
I am pleased to be here today, filling in for someone.

449
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:24,740
As we ran into each other earlier today, you said this
would be an exciting committee meeting, and it is.

450
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:28,200
Mr. Antonopoulos, thanks for coming
and thanks for your answers so far.

451
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:39,500
Who are Bitcoin's biggest detractors,
and why are they enemies of Bitcoin?

452
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:43,240
[ANDREAS] I am not sure who Bitcoin's 
biggest detractors are, but I can tell you that...

453
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:49,160
I -- and every other passionate advocate
I know -- started off as a detractor.

454
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:59,920
It is important to note that my initial response to Bitcoin
was, "This is nerd money and it can't possibly work."

455
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:07,480
[Laughter] In fact, when Satoshi Nakamoto invented
Bitcoin and announced it on the cyherpunk mailing list,

456
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:11,320
everyone around him responded
in pretty much the same way.

457
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:20,400
The circle of advocates, which is now numbering in the
millions, consists of people who started as sceptics.

458
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:25,580
The first time I saw it, that was my reaction.
The second time, I read the whitepaper...

459
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:27,720
and understood that this was not [just] a currency.

460
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:34,200
It is a decentralized network model for financial
security and trust which [relies on] currency,

461
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,660
but also allows for many other things.

462
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:41,360
That literally blew my mind, and then
I understood this was much bigger.

463
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:47,960
We all started out as skeptics. I don't know 
if all the skeptics become advocates over time,

464
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:55,300
but I do see that people who look at Bitcoin carefully
understand there is a lot more than meets the eye.

465
00:42:55,300 --> 00:43:00,960
[DAVID WELLS] What would Bitcoin's 
biggest threat to growth [and adoption] be?

466
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:06,300
[The need] for people to overcome fear
of the unknowns? The security aspect?

467
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:08,480
The level of technology available?

468
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:15,880
The individual nodes might not have
the security that the whole system has.

469
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:21,500
[ANDREAS] There are some very significant 
security problems related to the ownership...

470
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:25,620
and control of bitcoin keys in wallets for end-users.

471
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:31,260
The simple truth is, we have been [studying] information
security as an industry for a handful of decades.

472
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:37,760
That industry is not very effective at doing it, whether
in trying to protect credit card [details] or bitcoin.

473
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:44,400
The nice thing about bitcoin is, the risk is 
compartmentalized. There is no systemic risk.

474
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:49,340
Over time, we will see the development of more
secure mechanisms like hardware wallets,

475
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:53,120
such as the ones beginning
to appear in the market today.

476
00:43:53,120 --> 00:44:00,020
For every problem I see in Bitcoin, as an entrepreneur
I simultaneously see a tremendous opportunity.

477
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:07,760
If you look back at the history of disruptive technologies,
in 1994 there were dozens and dozens of articles...

478
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:13,000
about how the internet would fail because no one
would ever be able to find anything on the internet.

479
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,720
Sergey Brin and Larry Page decided
that was an opportunity, not a problem.

480
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:28,080
With Bitcoin, in each one of these problems lies a new,
innovative financial industry that can offer solutions.

481
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:30,700
[DAVID WELLS] Thank you.
I have one more question, Chair, if I may.

482
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:38,340
Of the millions of users a bitcoin currently, 
who would constitute the biggest user group?

483
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:46,960
International financial transactions?
What is the user group with the highest plurality?

484
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:52,820
[ANDREAS] I think there are a few statistical
surveys that provide some insight into that.

485
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:57,140
I'm not sure about the exact numbers.
I think the most common use for bitcoin is...

486
00:44:57,140 --> 00:45:01,700
charitable giving, donations and [online] tipping.

487
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:06,600
The demographics, at the moment,
are very similar to the early internet:

488
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:13,200
a narrow [set] of technology professionals.

489
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,880
A lot of nerds in this space,
I can say that for sure.

490
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:25,160
But it just follows the same [adoption] path as
any other technology, becoming more appealing...

491
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:29,200
to a broader demographic over time.

492
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:34,760
For me, the most interesting thing is not what
Bitcoin can do for western developed countries.

493
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:38,620
We have fairly sophisticated banking systems.

494
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:47,660
I am fascinated by the idea of deploying Bitcoin on
a Nokia feature phone in Kenya or Lagos, Nigeria...

495
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:53,300
This would people who have never had access
to financial services online into a global economy...

496
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:59,780
with international credit, connected to 
everyone else in the world on equal footing.

497
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:06,220
That is very exciting to me; that is where 
the greatest need lies that Bitcoin can fulfill.

498
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:09,260
[DAVID WELLS] Okay. Thank you, Chair.
[IRVING GERSTEIN] Thank you, Senator Wells.

499
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:13,720
Senator Ringuette, to be followed by Senator Meredith.
[PIERRETTE RINGUETTE] Thank you, Chair.

500
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:20,040
Most impressive. When you started out
by saying that you have spent 20 years...

501
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:28,140
working on networks and data centers
for financial services companies, I say,

502
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:34,500
they must be in dire need to hire you back! [Laughter]

503
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:38,520
[UNKNOWN] He is not for sale.
[PIERRETTE RINGUETTE] No, but-

504
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:46,700
With all the knowledge you have
gathered about cryptocurrency...

505
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:56,860
What would be your guess for development 
to create a similar cryptocurrency?

506
00:46:56,860 --> 00:47:00,880
[ANDREAS] I'm not sure I understand the question.
[PIERRETTE RINGUETTE] Well, as you said,

507
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:07,820
there are over about hundred
different cryptocurrency networks.

508
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:18,000
What would be the cost to develop and 
create a similar cryptocurrency to bitcoin?

509
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:24,900
[ANDREAS] Well, every day, somebody decides that
Bitcoin isn't the correct answer, they have a better one,

510
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:30,100
and choose to try and build a better cryptocurrency.

511
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:38,640
Blockchain technology has taken the very 
natural inclination of people to create currency...

512
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:43,020
as a form of language and expression
of value, which exists in every society.

513
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:53,200
From pre-historic times with beads and feathers,
to modern times with all the forms of currency...

514
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:58,360
that existed before nationalized monopoly money.

515
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:08,400
That possibility, of not only creating a currency,
but that currency being global, secure, fast,

516
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,460
predictable, and transparent...

517
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:18,520
It means a ten-year-old can create
a currency that is as secure as...

518
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:23,020
the currency created by a monarch a few centuries ago.

519
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:30,080
Just like the internet brought desktop publishing
and communications into the hands of individuals,

520
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:39,840
enable a capability that was previously only the
purview of those who had [large] printing presses,

521
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:44,220
blockchain technology has democratized 
access to [the tools of] currency creation.

522
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:53,940
As a result, anyone with the impulse to create currency,
for reasons completely serious or trivial, can now do so.

523
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:59,400
That currency [could become]
global, secure, and unforgeable.

524
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,840
[PIERRETTE RINGUETTE] Without cost?
[ANDREAS] Without cost.

525
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:06,720
In fact, you can go onto a website
and create RinguetteCoin today.

526
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:12,120
[PIERRETTE RINGUETTE] I would love that! [Laughter]
[ANDREAS] For a fifth of a tenth of a bitcoin.

527
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:17,540
For a very small amount, in any case.
Very soon, that will be free.

528
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:24,900
I do anticipate that you will see coins created by
children, performers, entertainers, football teams...

529
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:32,700
Most of them will only have entertainment value,
but some of them may surprise us and cross over...

530
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:34,580
into the realm of economic value.

531
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:42,520
[Bitcoin] changes the fundamental relationship between
individuals and currency as a form of expression.

532
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:46,800
[PIERRETTE RINGUETTE] The second question I have...

533
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:57,640
You said, individual bitcoin wallets can be targeted
and compromised if not properly secured.

534
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:02,880
How can one properly secure [their] bitcoin wallet?

535
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:08,300
[ANDREAS] With great difficulty right now.
It requires great technical skill,

536
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:12,720
which is one of the issues that needs
to be addressed over the next few years...

537
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:16,440
in order to make bitcoin more
accessible to mainstream users.

538
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:19,680
Right now, it is difficult to do so.

539
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:25,140
Our individual computer systems are not 
designed to secure purely digital money...

540
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:31,280
that resides on your iPhone or desktop.

541
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:40,260
For experts and specialists, there are new devices which
have come out, with wallets embedded in hardware.

542
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:45,760
Small devices that you plug into your computer
and all the bitcoin keys are only held on that device.

543
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:52,080
I actually print out my bitcoin keys on paper,
and then put them in a fireproof safe.

544
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:55,990
I store a second copy in a bank safe deposit box...

545
00:50:55,990 --> 00:51:02,840
which is ironic because I'm securing my bitcoin
by putting [the keys] in a bank vault. [Laughter]

546
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:12,220
Making the keys physical actually allows me to impart
the greatest form of security that I know how to use.

547
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:15,540
Physical security is something we're more familiar with.

548
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:19,600
Information security [research] is 
accelerating because of bitcoin.

549
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:24,800
A lot of innovation is happening in
that space, which is very exciting.

550
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,380
[PIERRETTE RINGUETTE] Third question.

551
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:36,560
You indicated that a person could acquire 
a loan in bitcoin. How would one go about that?

552
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:41,660
[ANDREAS] There are already organizations 
implementing a concept called peer-to-peer lending,

553
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:44,340
which exists in the traditional currencies.

554
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:54,940
For example, there are companies like LendingClub.com
where I can make a loan to a fellow American.

555
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:59,619
They will end up paying a lower interest rate than
for credit cards, and I will actually get an interest rate...

556
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:02,600
that is higher than I would with a certificate of deposit.

557
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:07,920
If I diversify my loans enough,
only investing a small amount in each loan,

558
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:11,240
I will suffer a pretty low default rate.

559
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:18,000
[With Bitcoin], that [scheme] can become global.
I could lend money with bitcoin to someone...

560
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,540
anywhere in the world, and there
are companies already doing this.

561
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:28,360
In that case, I would invest perhaps in
two to three thousand different loans so...

562
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:33,680
default on one loan wouldn't affect
my entire my entire amount.

563
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:39,980
[I would] diversify my risk that way. This has
tremendous implications for world-wide credit.

564
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:46,980
It not only allows people in the developing world
to source credit, but people in the developed world...

565
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:53,740
can invest their money directly with the borrowers,
without intermediaries, at a much lower cost.

566
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:57,940
[PIERRETTE RINGUETTE] Well, yeah,
but you have an intermediary for this.

567
00:52:57,940 --> 00:53:11,180
You have this organization that [facilitates] what you are
prepared to loan, and people wanting to acquire loans.

568
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:13,840
So you have this intermediary?

569
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:17,380
[ANDREAS] Today, we have. Yes, indeed.

570
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:20,520
But with bitcoin, this is one of the 
tremendous things that is happening.

571
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:26,140
Many of the traditional financial services 
can now be redesigned and re-envisioned...

572
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:29,480
in a completely decentralized
fashion, without intermediaries.

573
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:35,240
This concept of disintermediation, or removing
intermediaries, connecting buyers the sellers directly,

574
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:43,900
consumers to merchants, [borrowers] to 
creditors, is the magical power of Bitcoin.

575
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:50,060
That is what this invention has allowed us to do,
without [needing] to first establish trust.

576
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:54,700
With Bitcoin, we can have a completely 
decentralized market for credit and lending...

577
00:53:54,700 --> 00:54:01,980
that is simultaneously global, near instantaneous,
and allows access to a vast pool of credit.

578
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:07,300
That is a very exciting prospect.

579
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:16,880
[PIERRETTE RINGUETTE] Okay. From your perspective..
and Chair, this is my last question.

580
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:26,640
If Canada would move forward with some regulation,
as some witnesses have asked of us,

581
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:36,720
and the [rest of] the world, the G7 countries,
did not follow us with similar regulation,

582
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:43,580
what would the pros and cons of such a move be?

583
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:48,480
[ANDREAS] Well, that is a very interesting [question].
We already see tremendous regulatory fragmentation.

584
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:54,620
A regulator in New York State has taken initiative to
regulate based on [existing] New York State laws,

585
00:54:54,620 --> 00:55:02,440
regulation that looks very similar to traditional banking
regulations and is not very well suited for Bitcoin.

586
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:05,880
Simultaneously, there will be other forms of regulation.

587
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:13,620
In the United States, we will likely end up with
a patchwork of federal, state, and local regulations.

588
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:16,480
You will see similar attempts in many countries.

589
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:23,000
Bitcoin technology is such that it can 
operate across borders very effectively.

590
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:30,260
Therefore, Bitcoin companies can migrate 
to the areas of least friction, create new jobs,

591
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:36,080
[contribute] innovation and growth in the places
where regulation is best informed about the nuances..

592
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:39,120
and particular needs of Bitcoin companies.

593
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:44,440
Canada and other countries which are 
looking at this regulation very carefully,

594
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:49,460
rather than rushing into it, have an opportunity to create
a very friendly environment to those companies.

595
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:54,480
They will attract one of the industries that, 
quite frankly, is creating thousands of jobs today,

596
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:57,840
which cannot be said for too many other industries.

597
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:59,800
[PIERRETTE RINGUETTE] Thank you.
[ANDREAS] Thank you.

598
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:01,020
[IRVING GERSTEIN] Thank you very much.

599
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:05,680
Senator Meredith, to be followed by the 
Deputy Chair, Senator Hervieux-Payette.

600
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:08,880
[DON MEREDITH] Thank you so much, Chair.
Thank you so much for your presentation.

601
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:13,220
As I was reading your notes last night-
This is a segue into what my colleague just raised...

602
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:16,280
with respect to regulations.

603
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:24,520
Our committees here in the Senate are looking to put
forward recommendations in a report to government...

604
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:28,300
that will hopefully become law to protect Canadians.

605
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:33,940
You talked to us about individuals being hacked.

606
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:42,360
Companies who you cited earlier have spent millions
and millions of dollars on their security architecture,

607
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:47,280
to protect the data provided by consumers.

608
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:53,820
We see how vulnerable they are,
how this data has been lost.

609
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:59,660
Major banks have come and indicated that 
they have been hacked months [after the fact],

610
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:05,460
to the surprise of their customers whose credit cards,
[identity and financial] data is now out there.

611
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:10,980
Now you are advocating a decentralized system.

612
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:18,740
The traditional banking system is predicated on
all these security measures to protect consumers.

613
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:24,600
We are about protecting Canadians, so bring
[this discussion] back as to how we would do that...

614
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:27,500
going forward with Bitcoin and what you're proposing.

615
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:34,560
I understand the rationale of [open] access,
especially when it comes to Africa, for example.

616
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:36,480
and the other outlying areas.

617
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:41,020
We have seen how the revolution of cellphones
has changed the dynamics of communication,

618
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:43,400
as well as financial transactions.

619
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:46,000
Talk to us about the security aspect.

620
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:56,680
How would we go forth with respect to protecting
Canadians who are or become engaged in [Bitcoin]?

621
00:57:56,680 --> 00:58:03,180
[ANDREAS] One of the big failures of regulation
in the traditional [financial] environment is,

622
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:10,780
with centralized identifiers and regulation 
comes the centralization of risk.

623
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:21,540
When an organization such as Home Depot or Target
is hacked, losing sixty million consumer identities,

624
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:25,600
the reason that [hack] had such an enormous impact...

625
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:30,120
is because they were storing sixty million 
consumer identities in the first place.

626
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:39,220
Instead, if each of those sixty million consumers
[needed] to be individually targeted and hacked,

627
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:42,940
the possibility of that happening is much lower.

628
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:52,360
The advantage of a decentralized environment is,
there is no central repository, motherload, or vault...

629
00:58:52,360 --> 00:59:00,520
where everyone's identity is stored
and can be attacked at the same time.

630
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:11,260
Bitcoin proposes a different model where the risk and
control are pushed out into the hands of the users.

631
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:17,600
The result is a system that is much
more resilient against systemic risk.

632
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:25,320
That means users themselves have enormous power;
with that power, they also have responsibility.

633
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:29,940
That control exposes them to individualized risk.

634
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:34,260
[DON MEREDITH] How do we mitigate that risk, though?
[ANDREAS] That risk is already being mitigated...

635
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:35,540
by [various] innovations [and training].

636
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:41,320
On one hand, you have this increased 
exposure of the individual one-by-one;

637
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:50,360
on the other hand, we have programmable money,
which allows us to invent new models for security.

638
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:56,680
Whether those are specialized devices that control keys and never expose them to the internet,

639
00:59:56,680 --> 01:00:07,480
or multi-signature transactions where a number
of signatures are required to release funds.

640
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:13,140
Those signatures could belong to two 
different devices that one user [owns].

641
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:19,920
For example, they need to authorize a transaction
from their laptop and their mobile phone,

642
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:23,140
which gives them a greater degree of security.

643
01:00:23,140 --> 01:00:30,860
You could have secondary or tertiary controls
stored on paper, on a device that is kept offline,

644
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:33,340
in a vault at home, or a fireproof safe.

645
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:37,440
Those are the very basic [procedures]
that we are following right now.

646
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:43,720
But we are already seeing companies 
providing services to consumers...

647
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:50,720
where they look at every [outgoing] transaction
and provide a third signature to authorize it,

648
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:52,240
based on a risk assessment.

649
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:57,760
In that case, the company has no
custodial control over the funds.

650
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:05,340
All they can do is sign or not sign the transaction.
They are providing a risk check, and just that.

651
01:01:05,340 --> 01:01:09,160
These are very interesting models
we have never explored before,

652
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:16,140
because neither the user had enough control, nor was
the network open enough to allow experimentation.

653
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:20,840
The technology underlying it wasn't flexible enough.

654
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:26,560
I have great faith. Already, just in the last two years
as this technology has gone [more] mainstream,

655
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:31,540
the amount of innovation around that exact 
problem has accelerated tremendously.

656
01:01:31,540 --> 01:01:38,860
We are gradually beginning to win
in terms of protecting end-user wallets.

657
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:45,880
In this area specifically, requiring users to attach identity
to every transaction and put all of those [identities]...

658
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:52,440
in a central repository, just like the regulations
in New York have demanded, is folly to me.

659
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:58,560
It takes away the one opportunity we have 
to think of a different way of doing this,

660
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:07,540
and expose us to the same systemic risk of centralized
points of failure that we have with credit cards.

661
01:02:07,540 --> 01:02:13,020
I'm hoping that the market will be
allowed to develop these solutions.

662
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:19,540
[DON MEREDITH] Going forward with what one of
my colleagues, Senator Black, raised with respect to...

663
01:02:19,540 --> 01:02:25,360
breathing time, and you indicated this as well...

664
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:34,020
What would be a suitable timeframe for us to look?
Obviously, this is evolving and in development.

665
01:02:34,020 --> 01:02:39,860
However, we believe there needs to be 
some sort of regulations put in place,

666
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:49,120
similar to what we have done with the internet in terms
of privacy, requests for information, and so forth.

667
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:54,540
With respect to the breathing time,
if we were to enact some sort of legislation,

668
01:02:54,540 --> 01:03:03,240
give us your opinion as to what that would look like,
to govern Bitcoin and its transactions.

669
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:07,940
[ANDREAS] If we look at the
experience with the internet,

670
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:16,240
the opportunity for the internet to develop its own
models for self-regulation was extremely effective.

671
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:19,240
It delivered a lot of good to a lot of people.

672
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:26,200
Ironically, when the U.S. Senate finally came around
to regulating spam, that was the same year...

673
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:29,500
that technology solved the problem.

674
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:34,520
In some cases, waiting is the better option.

675
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:39,860
I don't think there is a major problem with 
consumer access to bitcoin at the moment,

676
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:42,220
in terms of the risk it poses to consumers.

677
01:03:42,220 --> 01:03:49,180
However, there are particular areas where 
I believe your committee could offer clarity.

678
01:03:49,180 --> 01:03:55,540
The first one is making a clear distinction 
between centralized, custodial accounts,

679
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:59,260
and decentralized models of bitcoin operation.

680
01:03:59,260 --> 01:04:01,160
Not lumping them together.

681
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:04,200
Centralized custodial accounts
are dangerous to consumers.

682
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:09,040
They expose consumers to the exact same risk
of [traditional] centralized financial institutions,

683
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:13,640
only in this particular case, there is still zero
oversight or control over these institutions.

684
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:16,280
They [often] operate outside
of the banking environment.

685
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:23,640
For example, when CA Vertex came here and asked for
regulation, in that environment, that is a sensible idea.

686
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:31,740
CA Vertex has complete control of user keys
and operates in a centralized, custodial manner.

687
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:39,100
However, I think we should leave opportunities
for the development of decentralized solutions,

688
01:04:39,100 --> 01:04:43,880
and recognize that those are neither 
subject to the same risks for consumers,

689
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:49,900
nor do they need the same types of regulation custodial accounts.

690
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:54,980
That would open up a lot of possibility
for innovation in that space.

691
01:04:54,980 --> 01:05:00,220
I think it is also important to carve out exceptions.

692
01:05:00,220 --> 01:05:10,360
There are exceptions already in existing law,
in terms of personal exchanges of small accounts.

693
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:15,520
For example, if I exchange a small amount of U.S.
dollars for Canadian dollars on the street corner,

694
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:21,200
I will not be arrested for operating
without the money transmitting license.

695
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:29,700
It is important to recognize that, on a small scale and
for personal use, there should be clarity in the law...

696
01:05:29,700 --> 01:05:33,480
that you don't require licenses to operate...

697
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:39,080
and personal use as a consumer is not 
subject to banking-level regulation.

698
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:44,740
That would be very useful in allowing 
further development of this technology.

699
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:47,140
[DON MEREDITH] One final question, Chair.

700
01:05:47,140 --> 01:05:55,380
He indicated that there is a small percentage of
bad actors. What systems do you currently have...

701
01:05:55,380 --> 01:06:01,980
in place to deal with those individuals
who would abuse the system?

702
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:09,800
[ANDREAS] Traditional law enforcement has been
tremendously successful in tracking and stopping...

703
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:13,080
such activities on the network, again and again.

704
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:19,880
So far, I haven't heard of any particular need
for changing the way the network operates.

705
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:26,000
In fact, such a request would be met with no
[such] change, because this is a global network.

706
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:34,800
It isn't under the control of a single individual. I don't
control Bitcoin any more than anybody else controls it.

707
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:42,120
The network itself provides a level of transparency
that law enforcement can use [to track that activity].

708
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:44,300
[DON MEREDITH] Thank you. Thanks, Chair.

709
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:45,580
[IRVING GERSTEIN] Deputy Chair of the committee,

710
01:06:45,580 --> 01:06:48,600
Senator Hervieux-Payette,
to be followed by Senator Tkachuk.

711
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:55,700
[HERVIEUX-PAYETTE] [Translated from French]
Thank you. In view of the fact that no one has...

712
01:06:55,700 --> 01:06:59,480
spoken in French so far, I will be
putting my questions in French.

713
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:12,040
Can you tell me whether there are countries, at the
present time, that recognize and supervise Bitcoin?

714
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:17,280
[ANDREAS] I believe that there are several countries
in which Bitcoin use has been recognized,

715
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:23,260
in many different ways and at different 
levels of the legislative or judicial process.

716
01:07:23,260 --> 01:07:27,140
In terms of recognizing, in fact, that bitcoin is money,

717
01:07:27,140 --> 01:07:33,900
that it is subject to the same rules and 
regulations around taxation and operation,

718
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:39,420
and that it also carries certain liberties such
as freedom of association and expression.

719
01:07:39,420 --> 01:07:45,940
Within many countries, bitcoin fits comfortably
within the existing system for currencies.

720
01:07:45,940 --> 01:07:55,600
However, I don't know whether any country 
required legislation specifically for bitcoin,

721
01:07:55,600 --> 01:08:02,920
[HERVIEUX-PAYETTE] [Translated from French]
A short question on a matter previously raised:

722
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:12,520
If Senator Ringuette were to issue RinguetteCoin this
week, and if our Chair already had his bitcoin for...

723
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:19,520
a number of months already, I would like to know what
the value of one in relation to the other would be.

724
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:25,200
[ANDREAS] The various [crypto]currencies that exist...

725
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:33,040
are related to each other based on a free-floating
market exchange rate, determined by trade...

726
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:40,080
between individuals on exchanges where those
currencies can be bought and sold for each other.

727
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:44,660
This is exactly the same mechanism by 
which the exchange rate between the...

728
01:08:44,660 --> 01:08:47,140
Canadian dollar and U.S. dollar is determined.

729
01:08:47,140 --> 01:08:54,580
Or between any currency in the modern world.
All of these currencies have a free-floating market value.

730
01:08:54,580 --> 01:09:05,620
I would argue, if there is very low liquidity in the market,
that it will be very difficult to establish a price...

731
01:09:05,620 --> 01:09:09,560
that is representative of the value of that currency.

732
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:16,860
Price discovery will be difficult
and lead to very large volatility.

733
01:09:16,860 --> 01:09:22,680
As bitcoin and the other [crypto]currencies 
[grow] larger, the volatility decreases, in fact.

734
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:29,440
The volatility of the bitcoin [price] today is 
not at all dissimilar from the volatility of oil...

735
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:39,940
during the first decade of its discovery
as a substitute fuel instead of whale oil.

736
01:09:39,940 --> 01:09:45,700
We see this with new technologies. As the market
develops, it starts off with tremendous volatility.

737
01:09:45,700 --> 01:09:53,140
But over time, as the amount of volume and liquidity
in the market increases, the volatility is reduced...

738
01:09:53,140 --> 01:09:56,660
until these currencies become extremely stable.

739
01:09:56,660 --> 01:10:02,480
For a global currency, a $5 billion valuation is tiny.

740
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:07,200
I would expect the bitcoin price will
remain volatile for many years to come.

741
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:14,200
[HERVIEUX-PAYETTE] [Translated from French]
I think Senator Ringuette can give some thought...

742
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:17,440
to this $5 billion.

743
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:24,740
There was another subject that was discussed,
namely the matter of security in the use of bitcoins.

744
01:10:24,740 --> 01:10:32,140
We are parliamentarians here,
doing this study within a parliament.

745
01:10:32,140 --> 01:10:36,120
After this particular committee, I will
be sitting on the finance committee.

746
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:41,880
I would be interested to know more about the control
that governments might be able to exercise...

747
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:46,780
if all operations are conducted in bitcoin 
and the value is constantly changing.

748
01:10:46,780 --> 01:10:54,300
How would a government be
able to exercise its fiscal power?

749
01:10:54,300 --> 01:11:00,220
[ANDREAS] Well, the citizens of that government
would exercise direct control over the currency...

750
01:11:00,220 --> 01:11:02,860
through their own purchasing decisions.

751
01:11:02,860 --> 01:11:07,600
Through ownership, they would have 
control over their own units of currency.

752
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:12,980
In many cases, as I mentioned
before, Bitcoin is not unregulated.

753
01:11:12,980 --> 01:11:20,460
It is regulated by mathematics as well as dynamic
markets that exist among its participants and users.

754
01:11:20,460 --> 01:11:27,220
The price of bitcoin, its value in commercial 
transactions, or whatever use to which it is put,

755
01:11:27,220 --> 01:11:33,620
is managed directly by the end-user,
who are arguably the same constituents.

756
01:11:33,620 --> 01:11:39,440
If the constituents can apply direct 
control over currency, they will do so.

757
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:46,640
[HERVIEUX-PAYETTE] [Translated from French]
My last question, then.

758
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:53,720
We talked about the value in the month of June.
We will be making our tax returns in April.

759
01:11:53,720 --> 01:12:01,540
What value would we use if we wanted to be
able to make conversions for tax authorities?

760
01:12:01,540 --> 01:12:07,460
Of course, when filing a tax return,
it is necessary to establish a value.

761
01:12:07,460 --> 01:12:15,320
If there is a serious amount of fluctuation...
I realize that the quantities are not high.

762
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:22,360
There aren't that many taxpayers with huge incomes.
Let's say, the average Canadian earns $45,000 per year.

763
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:32,460
What value would be attributed to the revenue
from January, February, March, and so forth?

764
01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:38,160
How would it be possible to monitor and control
this type of declaration of income or revenue?

765
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:44,420
[ANDREAS] That is a very interesting question, an area
where regulatory clarity would be extremely useful.

766
01:12:44,420 --> 01:12:50,340
I earn the vast majority of my income directly in bitcoin.

767
01:12:50,340 --> 01:12:56,420
Since October of last year, I have earned 
very little in terms of national currencies.

768
01:12:56,420 --> 01:13:01,340
I get paid in bitcoin, and pay many
of my expenses directly in bitcoin.

769
01:13:01,340 --> 01:13:06,880
For the purposes of taxation, I treat the 
bitcoin as earnings in a foreign currency,

770
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:12,320
just as if I would be doing contract work for 
a European company and being paid in euros.

771
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:18,880
I will assess the market value of the transaction
when I earn the income, at that market price.

772
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:23,360
Then I will render taxes to the tax
authority in the national currency.

773
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:30,620
After all, the primary power of the tax authority is
forcing people to pay in the currency of their choice.

774
01:13:30,620 --> 01:13:35,760
What becomes difficult in the use of currency is...

775
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:41,460
Its classification in the tax code
depends on the use I have for it.

776
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:47,140
For example, if I use my brokerage account 
to purchase euros for investment purposes,

777
01:13:47,140 --> 01:13:56,960
and I sell those euros two months later,
I realize a gain and am subject to capital gains tax.

778
01:13:56,960 --> 01:14:13,000
However, if I visit Paris, use euros to pay for a ticket
to the local Paris Zoo, and the value of the euro...

779
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:19,160
changes between the moment I purchased [the euros]
with my own currency, and when I pay for the ticket,

780
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:23,400
I will not assessed for capital gains taxes
because that is considered a currency use.

781
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:25,880
Therefore, it is treated differently.

782
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:32,400
[In that instance], the tax code is flexible enough
to allow me to declare the appropriate use...

783
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:35,820
for tax classification, depending on how I used it.

784
01:14:35,820 --> 01:14:43,220
At the moment, in the United States, there has
been a ruling that bitcoin operates as a commodity...

785
01:14:43,220 --> 01:14:47,980
[subject to] capital gains taxation,
which is the wrong answer in my opinion.

786
01:14:47,980 --> 01:14:54,080
However, if bitcoin had been classified purely as
currency, that would be the wrong answer too.

787
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:57,760
The correct answer, in my opinion,
should be that it depends on how it is used.

788
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:03,040
If it is used for investment, then obviously
it is subject to capital gains and losses.

789
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:08,200
But if it is used for consumer spending, then it
operates as a currency and medium of exchange.

790
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:14,660
The tax system [should] allow me to 
declare how I have used the currency,

791
01:15:14,660 --> 01:15:18,140
and then impose penalties if I have
made that declaration incorrectly.

792
01:15:18,140 --> 01:15:20,840
That is how it works with every other currency.

793
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:26,900
This is an area where clarity would be extremely useful.
It would allow us to use currencies such as bitcoin...

794
01:15:26,900 --> 01:15:30,820
in the same way that we use [other] 
currencies from all over the world.

795
01:15:30,820 --> 01:15:33,080
[HERVIEUX-PAYETTE] Thank you.
[IRVING GERSTEIN] Thank you.

796
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:36,380
Senator Tkachuk, to be followed by Senator Maltais.

797
01:15:36,380 --> 01:15:42,360
[DAVID TKACHUK] Welcome, Mr. Antonopoulos.
Thank you for your testimony here today.

798
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:46,920
It has been an interesting afternoon.

799
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:52,720
The other virtual currencies, are they
based on an algorithm as well?

800
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:57,920
Is it the same one as used for Bitcoin?

801
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:01,320
There are several algorithms within Bitcoin.

802
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:11,480
The central invention is the blockchain and the
security model for consensus through proof-of-work,

803
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:18,040
which is a [method] that allows a network to arrive
at a secure picture of what the current ledger is...

804
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:19,920
based on competition.

805
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:25,180
That central technological innovation, the blockchain,
is used in the vast majority of [crypto]currencies.

806
01:16:25,180 --> 01:16:27,460
I will call that the blockchain invention.

807
01:16:27,460 --> 01:16:33,920
However, there are other algorithms in Bitcoin, such as
the algorithm that determines how [units] are issued,

808
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:37,020
how often and how much of the currency is issued.

809
01:16:37,020 --> 01:16:42,420
Other currencies have taken different perspectives,
using a different monetary policy recipe.

810
01:16:42,420 --> 01:16:45,920
We have seen the development of a very 
broad range of choices, including currencies...

811
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:50,400
that are inflationary in nature
and have a much bigger supply.

812
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:59,160
Even currencies that implement a demurrage, meaning
a negative interest rate, to encourage consumption...

813
01:16:59,180 --> 01:17:00,800
and discourages savings.

814
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:11,440
As a laboratory, these currencies can express a range
of monetary policies and political perspectives.

815
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:20,240
The underlying invention that secures the entire network
is almost exactly the same across all these currencies.

816
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:29,840
[DAVID TKACHUK] We have heard in previous
testimony about the miners, the people who issue..

817
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:32,980
or "mine" the currency.

818
01:17:32,980 --> 01:17:42,900
There were some stories in
the paper in June of this year,

819
01:17:42,900 --> 01:17:51,120
[which said] a company had over 51% of the mining market for bitcoin.

820
01:17:51,120 --> 01:18:02,780
So it was developing like a quasi-monopoly. Can one
company have a total monopoly in issuing bitcoins?

821
01:18:02,780 --> 01:18:14,300
Does that jeopardize the whole currency itself?
Do you have controls on that? How does it all work?

822
01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:21,940
It is important to emphasize that the purpose of
mining is to secure and verify all transactions.

823
01:18:21,940 --> 01:18:29,100
The reward for mining is currency issuance,
which we should not confuse for the main purpose.

824
01:18:29,100 --> 01:18:33,920
Mining is rewarded with currency
issuance for securing the network.

825
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:41,140
The reward acts as an incentive to
ensure that the network remains secure.

826
01:18:41,140 --> 01:18:50,300
The company in question is a mining organization.
It operates a mining pool, similar to a lottery pool,

827
01:18:50,300 --> 01:18:53,420
which means they didn't control the hashing directly.

828
01:18:53,420 --> 01:19:03,060
They acted as a [facilitator] where many independent
miners could pool their hashing power in order to...

829
01:19:03,060 --> 01:19:07,280
achieve smoother returns on their hardware investment.

830
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:13,700
When playing the lottery by yourself,
you may win, but on a very irregular schedule.

831
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:20,620
If you play as part of a pool, you will get more
frequent, but lower, payments in a similar way.

832
01:19:20,620 --> 01:19:25,100
Mining is a competitive function, 
individuals do not fare [as well].

833
01:19:25,100 --> 01:19:28,860
Their payments [are irregular].
Instead, they pull their actions together.

834
01:19:28,860 --> 01:19:35,020
Interestingly, when GHash.IO approached -- 
but did not reach -- 51%, and [controlled above 40%],

835
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:44,600
this led to a market response where individual miners
recognized the potential risk to the reputation...

836
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:45,900
of the network.

837
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:48,740
Although, I don't believe it was a serious technical risk.

838
01:19:48,740 --> 01:19:55,600
They withdrew their mining capacity from that pool
operator and redirected it to other pool operators.

839
01:19:55,600 --> 01:20:05,760
Shortly thereafter, GHash.IO had their cumulative
mining power drop to slightly below 30%.

840
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:11,520
[This behaviour] provides a very good level 
of protection against individualized attacks.

841
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:18,500
That is a very big amount, but at the same time,
it is not big enough to provide a monopoly.

842
01:20:18,500 --> 01:20:24,920
On a technical note, a mining pool or individual
miner achieving the majority of the [hashpower]...

843
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:31,760
can potentially disrupt the transaction processing
function of the network, for a short term.

844
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:39,080
However, they cannot steal funds from any of the users,
re-direct funds from any of the [transactions].

845
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:42,880
and they cannot invalidate transactions.

846
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:49,860
They can only delay the processing. It is not
as big of a risk as most people believe it is.

847
01:20:49,860 --> 01:20:57,660
Because of the market mechanisms behind it, we see
again and again that it is a self-correcting system.

848
01:20:57,660 --> 01:21:07,520
[DAVID TKACHUK] Just so I can understand
whether it is a method of exchange or a currency...

849
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:17,560
If I have yen in Canada, I can't really buy anything.
I must go to a bank and exchange it for [dollars].

850
01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:24,980
No one takes [yen here]. I must go exchange it
for Canadian dollars so I can buy something.

851
01:21:24,980 --> 01:21:31,820
It is the same in each country. And in each country,
those [Canadian] dollars will have certain value.

852
01:21:31,820 --> 01:21:38,920
Even though my Canadian dollar trades up and down
compared to the U.S. dollar, as does everything else,

853
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:42,720
I still deal in Canadian dollars.

854
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:50,240
It basically stays the same for Canadian products,
unless it depends heavily on imports.

855
01:21:50,260 --> 01:21:57,940
Does the virtual sphere itself have its own stability?

856
01:21:57,940 --> 01:22:06,380
In other words, when something is priced in 
Europe for one bitcoin and I have one bitcoin,

857
01:22:06,380 --> 01:22:09,440
can I still buy that for one bitcoin even though...

858
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:18,720
the value of that bitcoin has changed in relation to
the currency of my country, or the American dollar?

859
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:24,440
[ANDREAS] The exchange rates between 
bitcoin and individual currencies such as...

860
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:27,720
the euro, Canadian dollars, U.S. dollars, etc.

861
01:22:27,720 --> 01:22:34,500
has sufficient liquidity that arbitrage is 
possible between the various exchanges.

862
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:40,780
This means the purchasing power of one bitcoin
is the same no matter what the national currency.

863
01:22:40,780 --> 01:22:43,660
The fluctuations are minuscule because...

864
01:22:43,660 --> 01:22:47,460
with any serious fluctuation, if I could
buy bitcoin cheaper for Canadian dollars,

865
01:22:47,460 --> 01:22:50,180
then sell it more expensively for U.S. dollars,

866
01:22:50,180 --> 01:22:54,140
that creates an immediate opportunity
for arbitrage between the two markets.

867
01:22:54,140 --> 01:23:00,880
That's exactly what is happening. In many cases,
arbitrage in bitcoin is even more effective because...

868
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:05,940
the bitcoin can be transferred between exchanges
almost instantaneously and across borders.

869
01:23:05,940 --> 01:23:10,940
In traditional financial markets, moving 
money like that takes [quite] a bit longer.

870
01:23:10,940 --> 01:23:15,820
The differences between national 
currencies even out very quickly.

871
01:23:15,820 --> 01:23:17,340
There are [few] fluctuations there.

872
01:23:17,340 --> 01:23:24,200
My bitcoin purchasing power, while volatile overall,
is the same across any national currency.

873
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:31,400
[DAVID TKACHUK] Can you see a time- Is that
where we are heading, where people internationally...

874
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:35,880
price things in bitcoins?

875
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:43,480
Things will be bought and sold in bitcoins, no matter
what is happening underneath to national currencies?

876
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:48,960
[Maybe] because you save so much
money in exchange, and all the rest of it.

877
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:53,420
Is that where we are going,
is that where we are heading?

878
01:23:53,420 --> 01:23:59,200
[ANDREAS] In the long-term, I believe bitcoin will be
stable enough in terms of volatility that it will be...

879
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:01,720
possible to price things directly in bitcoin.

880
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:08,080
At that moment, bitcoin [would] become a universal
currency in terms of its utility across the internet.

881
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:12,300
At least on the internet, that would make it 
extremely competitive against national currencies,

882
01:24:12,300 --> 01:24:16,400
both in terms of ease-of-use and flexibility.

883
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:23,860
I would expect that to happen. However, I think we are
several years away from the volatility [going down]...

884
01:24:23,860 --> 01:24:27,460
[enough] such that things
can be priced directly in bitcoin.

885
01:24:27,460 --> 01:24:32,200
[DAVID TKACHUK] Okay.
Could I have time for one more question?

886
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:35,980
Bitcoin can be stored.

887
01:24:35,980 --> 01:24:41,520
[For example], Senator Gerstein. I don't know where
he keeps his bitcoin. Where does he keep this bitcoin?

888
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:49,600
Do you keep it in your own wallet?
Is it a virtual wallet where you keep your bitcoins?

889
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:52,100
You can do that?

890
01:24:52,100 --> 01:24:57,540
[ANDREAS] This may be a tiny bit too technical,
but I'll provide you with some some insight anyway.

891
01:24:57,540 --> 01:25:02,220
The bitcoin are actually not stored by individuals.
They are stored on the network, on the public ledger.

892
01:25:02,220 --> 01:25:05,140
The public ledger knows who has [owns] what bitcoin.

893
01:25:05,140 --> 01:25:11,960
What Senator Gerstein has are the keys 
which allow him to sign for transactions,

894
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:14,620
essentially signatory control over those funds.

895
01:25:14,620 --> 01:25:16,360
[DAVID TKACHUK] The keys unlock it?
[ANDREAS] To unlock them.

896
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:19,800
How you store the keys, depends.
There are many ways to store the keys.

897
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:26,500
Effectively, they are just numbers. [To protect my keys],
I actually print those out on pieces of paper,

898
01:25:26,500 --> 01:25:28,140
and put them in a physical medium.

899
01:25:28,140 --> 01:25:35,300
I also have keys that control smaller amounts of bitcoin,
spending change if you like, on my mobile phone.

900
01:25:35,300 --> 01:25:40,800
I have some on my desktop. I have some 
on hardware devices that I am trying out.

901
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:43,880
But the vast majority [of the keys] are 
printed out as physical [paper] copies.

902
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:48,300
It is more secure. Those can't be hacked [remotely].
You would need to break into my house.

903
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:57,280
[DAVID TKACHUK] Companies, businesses will do
multiple transactions, thousands or millions per day.

904
01:25:57,300 --> 01:26:09,020
Can bitcoin adapt to that? Can you do payroll for a two
hundred, five hundred, a thousand people with bitcoin?

905
01:26:09,020 --> 01:26:15,020
With deductions and all the rest of it? Or is it an issue?
[ANDREAS] Not only can you do that...

906
01:26:15,020 --> 01:26:19,940
[DAVID TKACHUK] People are doing it?
[ANDREAS] A medium skilled programmer...

907
01:26:19,940 --> 01:26:28,920
can do that with a few hundred lines of code,
like in Python, accessing the [company wallet]...

908
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:33,940
and instructing it to do that, which is fascinating.

909
01:26:33,940 --> 01:26:41,580
Not only that, but they could do it for transactions to a
thousand people living in a hundred different countries,

910
01:26:41,580 --> 01:26:45,260
which is almost impossible to do with today's money.

911
01:26:45,260 --> 01:26:50,200
So if you try to do payroll- There are many companies
in the technology space [with that problem].

912
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:56,620
For example, Google pays tens of thousands
of affiliate companies for advertising revenue.

913
01:26:56,620 --> 01:27:03,140
The cost for them to pay these companies
that ad revenue across the world is enormous.

914
01:27:03,140 --> 01:27:10,300
The possibility of automating that and using a single
currency for electronic payments, it can be done.

915
01:27:10,300 --> 01:27:15,540
It can be done extremely fast, efficiently and globally.

916
01:27:15,540 --> 01:27:19,060
[DAVID TKACHUK] I like "cheaply," too.
[ANDREAS] And very cheaply.

917
01:27:19,060 --> 01:27:25,500
[IRVING GERSTEIN] Senator Maltais, please.

918
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:27,940
[GHISLAIN MALTAIS] [Translated from French]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

919
01:27:27,940 --> 01:27:32,620
First a short comment and then some questions.

920
01:27:32,620 --> 01:27:40,200
I agree with my colleague, Senator Campbell,
when he said that people of a certain age might...

921
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:44,900
have some trouble trying this out.

922
01:27:44,900 --> 01:27:53,240
We did have a machine and Chair generously bought
$100 worth of bitcoin. He never told us about it.

923
01:27:53,240 --> 01:28:02,760
I don't know what has become of it, whether there has
been a loss, but of course that is not your problem.

924
01:28:02,760 --> 01:28:11,940
You said that a user of bitcoin might be able
to predict the monetary supply in the future.

925
01:28:11,940 --> 01:28:21,760
For example, a user of bitcoin such as the Chair [could]
predict what the monetary supply will be in 30 years.

926
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:33,080
It seems to me that the Minister of Finance probably
should have made use of this for the next five years.

927
01:28:33,080 --> 01:28:40,600
It certainly seems to me that if you are able to
tell what the monetary supply will be in 30 years,

928
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:49,200
then this is a very useful knowledge.

929
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:57,520
[ANDREAS] Because Bitcoin is designed to simulate
the extraction of precious metals in its progression,

930
01:28:57,520 --> 01:29:01,880
it is entirely possible to predict, with very high accuracy,

931
01:29:01,880 --> 01:29:06,760
exactly how much currency will be available
on the market at a specific period of time.

932
01:29:06,760 --> 01:29:12,440
That doesn't necessarily mean that supply will
meet the demand, or that it is the correct supply.

933
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:15,240
We just know what that supply will be.

934
01:29:15,240 --> 01:29:23,780
Today, we can predict to a very high degree of accuracy
what the supply of gold will be over the next year.

935
01:29:23,780 --> 01:29:33,220
It has been extracted at a very predictable rate.
It works similarly with bitcoin.

936
01:29:33,220 --> 01:29:40,940
[GHISLAIN MALTAIS] On that particular point,
I think any insurance company actuary,

937
01:29:40,940 --> 01:29:50,000
when they establish an annuity over a period of 30 years,
are able to make a good prediction for the figures...

938
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:53,160
that will probably turn out to be quite realistic.

939
01:29:53,160 --> 01:30:00,160
So they don't need Bitcoin in order to establish
what the money supply will be in 30 years.

940
01:30:00,160 --> 01:30:04,140
They are able to make an extrapolation.
It is a very simple mathematical formula.

941
01:30:04,140 --> 01:30:07,300
This can be done by an actuary.

942
01:30:07,300 --> 01:30:11,760
But there is a question that I find quite puzzling.

943
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:23,440
Do you think that the Bitcoin system would 
be a duplicate of the present banking system?

944
01:30:23,440 --> 01:30:29,260
The banks are able to adapt
to any type of new technology.

945
01:30:29,260 --> 01:30:37,440
The World Bank, when it comes to capital, are
probably investing more in technological research...

946
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:45,260
on digital currency than Bitcoin could ever be.

947
01:30:45,260 --> 01:30:51,540
[ANDREAS] Bitcoin, or rather the invention 
behind Bitcoin, the blockchain technology,

948
01:30:51,540 --> 01:30:58,920
is an invention that will have a substantial 
influence over the future of banking.

949
01:30:58,920 --> 01:31:06,540
I have had several discussions with banks that
are very interested in using similar systems...

950
01:31:06,540 --> 01:31:10,960
in order to create more efficient
networks within the banking system.

951
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:24,500
For example, clearing operations such as those for
world-wide fund transfer, stock and equity purchases,

952
01:31:24,500 --> 01:31:26,720
are handled by intermediaries.

953
01:31:26,720 --> 01:31:30,200
Bitcoin would allow banks to handle those...

954
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:36,220
in a decentralized network by simulating the
same technology as Bitcoin on their own.

955
01:31:36,220 --> 01:31:42,300
Furthermore, banks in the developing world are
very interested in using bitcoin to extend services...

956
01:31:42,300 --> 01:31:45,240
to areas where they can't deploy infrastructure.

957
01:31:45,240 --> 01:31:51,560
Very similarly, at first telecommunications companies
were somewhat threatened by the internet,

958
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:55,120
but now run their networks on top of the internet.

959
01:31:55,120 --> 01:32:00,220
Banks will eventually find ways to utilize this technology.

960
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:06,780
I would not be surprised if big parts of financial
services systems eventually run on top of technology...

961
01:32:06,780 --> 01:32:11,620
very similar to Bitcoin, perhaps Bitcoin itself.

962
01:32:11,620 --> 01:32:16,100
[GHISLAIN MALTAIS] This leads me to ask you, then...

963
01:32:16,100 --> 01:32:22,720
Do you not have the impression that you were
swallowed up before you even came into existence?

964
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:30,100
The banks will never ever let you
have so much operating [room].

965
01:32:30,100 --> 01:32:34,640
I'm not just talking about Canadian or American
banks, I'm talking about banks in all the world.

966
01:32:34,640 --> 01:32:41,980
I don't think that the banks will
let this go by without reacting.

967
01:32:41,980 --> 01:32:44,380
I realize that this is quite successful.

968
01:32:44,380 --> 01:32:59,340
Young people are very enthused about it, but I don't
think banks will let themselves be dispossessed.

969
01:32:59,340 --> 01:33:06,980
Bitcoin is not a solid organization;
for the time being, it is simply a virtual one.

970
01:33:06,980 --> 01:33:09,080
[ANDREAS] I remember the exact same discussion...

971
01:33:09,080 --> 01:33:15,400
when the idea [was put forth that] the international
telecommunications union would be thwarted...

972
01:33:15,400 --> 01:33:19,460
or even somehow threatened by this 
nascent technology called the internet.

973
01:33:19,460 --> 01:33:27,860
That idea [seemed] ridiculous on its face; the idea
that states would allow the internet to give people...

974
01:33:27,860 --> 01:33:30,960
freedom of expression was preposterous.

975
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:38,640
The idea that the internet would be allowed 
to subvert the will of despots around the world,

976
01:33:38,640 --> 01:33:44,480
and would not be instantly shut down whenever
they felt it was threatening their authority,

977
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:45,580
was preposterous.

978
01:33:45,580 --> 01:33:48,440
And yet, all of these things have happened.

979
01:33:48,440 --> 01:33:59,060
I believe that Bitcoin empowers individuals, especially
individuals who do not even have access to banking.

980
01:33:59,060 --> 01:34:05,980
It will create a thriving economy of its own,
an economy that will not threaten banks,

981
01:34:05,980 --> 01:34:08,700
but will open new opportunities for banks.

982
01:34:08,700 --> 01:34:12,200
In the end, just like the telecommunication companies,

983
01:34:12,220 --> 01:34:19,700
many of their old models and old profit 
sources will be fundamentally disrupted.

984
01:34:19,700 --> 01:34:26,220
Today, AT&T's long-distance network has been
decimated. Skype has dominated that space.

985
01:34:26,220 --> 01:34:31,860
Yet AT&T did not give up. They became one of
the world's largest internet service providers.

986
01:34:31,860 --> 01:34:38,200
Eventually, I believe that bitcoin [and bitcoin-like]
currencies will decimate certain industries,

987
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:46,420
especially high-profit, low-service industries such as
remittances, which are exploitative in their nature.

988
01:34:46,420 --> 01:34:51,540
They will open up new industries,
new products, and new services.

989
01:34:51,540 --> 01:34:59,140
Economic activity enabled by bringing together billions
of people on a fully connected, global financial system.

990
01:34:59,140 --> 01:35:08,160
[The benefits] will be so much bigger than the potential
risk this may pose to the profits of incumbents.

991
01:35:08,160 --> 01:35:12,380
[GHISLAIN MALTAIS] Thank you.
[IRVING GERSTEIN] This concludes round one.

992
01:35:12,380 --> 01:35:20,140
We will enter into round two. I have Senator Black,
Senator Massicotte, and Senator Greene on my list.

993
01:35:20,140 --> 01:35:22,860
Before turning it over to Senator Black...

994
01:35:22,860 --> 01:35:30,380
In your comments -- which have been fascinating --
you made reference to one of the great motivators...

995
01:35:30,380 --> 01:35:35,200
for you personally [becoming] involved in this,
is the technology that will bring [financial services]

996
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:41,520
to people who don't have it today, using the 
[line] "empowering billions around the world."

997
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:52,060
If I am correct, I believe Mr. Gates, in his charitable giving
in Africa, makes use of a digital currency called M-Pesa.

998
01:35:52,060 --> 01:36:05,360
Could you just expand a little on what impact bitcoin,
M-Pesa, digital currency in general, will have on Africa?

999
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:10,940
[ANDREAS] Absolutely. M-Pesa is a fascinating study
for those of us who are interested in digital currencies.

1000
01:36:10,940 --> 01:36:17,520
It has shown what is possible when low-friction
digital money is introduced into an environment...

1001
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:19,840
without the need for massive infrastructure.

1002
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:23,520
An environment that doesn't have
well-developed banking services.

1003
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:25,500
M-Pesa was started as an experiment...

1004
01:36:25,500 --> 01:36:32,100
that allowed individuals to transfer cellphone
minutes amongst themselves and their families,

1005
01:36:32,100 --> 01:36:35,500
through a telecom provider in Kenya.

1006
01:36:35,500 --> 01:36:40,600
I Imagine the moment this became a 
currency was a very mundane moment.

1007
01:36:40,600 --> 01:36:47,860
Maybe a customer arrived at a store and realized they
didn't have sufficient money to buy a dozen eggs.

1008
01:36:47,860 --> 01:36:51,720
Then asking, "Well, can I give you
a couple of cellphone minutes instead?"

1009
01:36:51,720 --> 01:36:55,400
With that simple concept, a currency is born.

1010
01:36:55,400 --> 01:37:01,820
What's fascinating about M-Pesa is, we roll forward
just twelve years and M-Pesa is now responsible for...

1011
01:37:01,820 --> 01:37:06,800
40% of the GDP of Kenya, a staggering amount.

1012
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:18,380
It represents the adoption of what was [previously] a
largely underground, cash-based, illiquid economy...

1013
01:37:18,380 --> 01:37:25,560
that was very slow to operate, and turbocharging that
by providing enormous liquidity and fluidity...

1014
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:28,700
into the economic system.

1015
01:37:28,700 --> 01:37:35,280
At the moment, Bitcoin is not ready to be adopted
easily on the most deployed platform in the world,

1016
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:40,320
which is a feature phone,
the Nokia 1000, of which there exist billions.

1017
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:48,200
It requires a bit more infrastructure than that,
but gradually we see two trends converging:

1018
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:51,700
First, bitcoin is being applied on
simpler and simpler technology.

1019
01:37:51,700 --> 01:37:55,540
We already see its use through SMS text messaging.

1020
01:37:55,540 --> 01:38:02,240
Second, the collapse in the cost of producing smart
phones, with the Android approaching about $25.

1021
01:38:02,240 --> 01:38:07,020
There are already applications in the Bitcoin space
that would allow a single Android phone to support...

1022
01:38:07,020 --> 01:38:12,460
thousands of simple SMS customers
by giving them bitcoin wallets.

1023
01:38:12,460 --> 01:38:20,080
That would allow a young kid in Lagos, Nigeria to
buy an Android smartphone and become a bank...

1024
01:38:20,080 --> 01:38:26,280
serving thousands of customers, giving them access
to the equivalent of a Western Union terminal,

1025
01:38:26,280 --> 01:38:32,700
a credit facility for buying loans, as well as 
a trading facility for all of the world's markets.

1026
01:38:32,700 --> 01:38:36,840
This could be run off a simple Android 
smartphone and SMS feature phones.

1027
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:42,560
M-Pesa showed us that it is possible;
Bitcoin makes that phenomenon global.

1028
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:48,820
in talking about the unbanked, the World Bank estimates
that 2.5 billion people are completely unbanked,

1029
01:38:48,820 --> 01:38:51,340
living in cash-based societies.

1030
01:38:51,340 --> 01:38:55,340
However, that vastly underestimates the problem.

1031
01:38:55,340 --> 01:38:59,480
If you [compare with] the types of banking 
facilities that we have in the western world,

1032
01:38:59,480 --> 01:39:05,200
the ability I have to access a brokerage account
[and pick from] any of the international markets,

1033
01:39:05,200 --> 01:39:14,060
to convert any currency I want without controls,
transmit money to any country in the world I want,

1034
01:39:14,060 --> 01:39:16,180
and to use it as a simple consumer...

1035
01:39:16,180 --> 01:39:20,520
[That experience] is very far removed
from what most people have.

1036
01:39:20,520 --> 01:39:26,640
If you look at the unbanked as those who have a single
currency, closed account that doesn't have access...

1037
01:39:26,640 --> 01:39:29,980
to international markets, credit, or trading capabilities,

1038
01:39:29,980 --> 01:39:34,880
more than six billion people in the
world live with that kind of banking.

1039
01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:42,280
Two and a half billion are completely unbanked.
Bitcoin can change that environment dramatically,

1040
01:39:42,280 --> 01:39:44,980
in less than a decade.

1041
01:39:44,980 --> 01:39:50,240
[IRVING GERSTEIN] Thank you.
Senator Black, to be followed by Senator Massicotte.

1042
01:39:50,240 --> 01:39:54,340
[DOUGLAS BLACK] Thank you very much, 
Mr. Chairman. I would just like to thank you,

1043
01:39:54,340 --> 01:39:56,720
again, for this contribution. It is extremely helpful.

1044
01:39:56,720 --> 01:40:00,400
I want to move to a couple of final points 
that I want to have clear in my mind.

1045
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:07,380
I want to take, from your comments,
arising from what Senator Ringuette asked...

1046
01:40:07,380 --> 01:40:12,860
Through this hearing, we have been exploring
the opportunity that may exist for Canada,

1047
01:40:12,860 --> 01:40:15,000
for innovation if we get this right.

1048
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:21,120
Can you succinctly tell us what
you think that opportunity is?

1049
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:24,520
[ANDREAS] Well, I think there are two aspects.

1050
01:40:24,520 --> 01:40:32,900
One is the pure research and technology innovation
capabilities that might exist in the Bitcoin sphere.

1051
01:40:32,900 --> 01:40:37,860
I like to emphasize is that bitcoin
is not just money for the internet.

1052
01:40:37,860 --> 01:40:41,620
To look at it simply as money for
the internet, is to miss the point.

1053
01:40:41,620 --> 01:40:46,160
Bitcoin is the internet of money.
Currency is just the first application.

1054
01:40:46,160 --> 01:40:52,460
Currency is an app running on a decentralized
trust network based on blockchain technology,

1055
01:40:52,460 --> 01:40:55,260
which means many other apps will exist.

1056
01:40:55,260 --> 01:41:02,680
The bitcoin currency is almost the same as email
was in the '90s. It enabled the growth of the internet.

1057
01:41:02,680 --> 01:41:09,140
It was the killer application that made it viable
and worthwhile for people to get involved,

1058
01:41:09,140 --> 01:41:15,240
but it couldn't possibly open our eyes to the 
endless possibilities which came afterwards.

1059
01:41:15,240 --> 01:41:22,400
The web, we couldn't envision that in the 
early '90s, or even Facebook and Twitter.

1060
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:25,420
Bitcoin the currency is just the tip of the iceberg.

1061
01:41:25,420 --> 01:41:32,540
It is the proto-technology that will bring 
this decentralized network to consumers.

1062
01:41:32,540 --> 01:41:36,560
But there will be other apps, and it is 
already evolving at a tremendous rate.

1063
01:41:36,560 --> 01:41:40,760
From a pure research and innovation 
perspective, I think it is incredible.

1064
01:41:40,760 --> 01:41:45,400
The other is to think about the possibilities 
of extending banking services [to new areas].

1065
01:41:45,400 --> 01:41:53,160
Even though Canada has a highly banked population,
there are still pockets within this country.

1066
01:41:53,160 --> 01:42:00,220
I know that in the U.S., close to 18% of the population
have no or very limited banking capabilities.

1067
01:42:00,220 --> 01:42:04,000
That is probably true of most developed nations.

1068
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:09,040
There are pockets within this country where
people have very little access to banks.

1069
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:15,480
I think the combination of doing primary research
and innovation in these new technologies,

1070
01:42:15,480 --> 01:42:23,440
and opening banking to reach different corners of
this country, disadvantaged parts of the population....

1071
01:42:23,440 --> 01:42:30,100
That is a very potent combination, especially if we take
advantage of the international aspects of this currency.

1072
01:42:30,100 --> 01:42:33,860
[DOUGLAS BLACK] Thank you very much. 
One last question, if I may, Mr. Chairman.

1073
01:42:33,860 --> 01:42:38,740
How did New York State get it wrong?

1074
01:42:38,740 --> 01:42:44,740
[ANDREAS] I think they got it wrong in many ways.
First of all, by rushing to regulate very soon.

1075
01:42:44,740 --> 01:42:54,780
More importantly, by regulating Bitcoin in exactly the
same way that the banking system currently operates,

1076
01:42:54,780 --> 01:43:02,020
failing to see the distinctions between 
Bitcoin and the current system.

1077
01:43:02,020 --> 01:43:09,340
The only analogy I can think of... if in proto-internet
stage, the Federal Communications Commmission...

1078
01:43:09,340 --> 01:43:15,340
in the United States had decided the internet was simply
a sophisticated form of citizens band (CB) radio...

1079
01:43:15,340 --> 01:43:18,780
and required a license for every website operator.

1080
01:43:18,780 --> 01:43:26,620
Such an outcome would have almost certainly
destroyed the internet industry in the United States.

1081
01:43:26,620 --> 01:43:30,080
However, because of the enormous need for such a tool,

1082
01:43:30,080 --> 01:43:32,660
it would not have affected the
internet industry everywhere else.

1083
01:43:32,660 --> 01:43:35,540
It would have simply pushed that innovation elsewhere.

1084
01:43:35,540 --> 01:43:42,720
I think treating bitcoin as a proto-bank account
with some fancy features is missing the point;

1085
01:43:42,720 --> 01:43:50,400
to regulate it as such would completely stifle it,
put it into the playing field of incumbents.

1086
01:43:50,400 --> 01:43:53,380
It ties up [Bitcoin companies]
in the same kinds of regulations.

1087
01:43:53,380 --> 01:44:02,220
It would force them to behave more like a bank,
when its unique characteristic is, it isn't a bank.

1088
01:44:02,220 --> 01:44:04,220
[DOUGLAS BLACK] Thank you very much. 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

1089
01:44:04,220 --> 01:44:08,160
[IRVING GERSTEIN] Thank you. Senator Massicotte,
to be followed by Senator Greene.

1090
01:44:08,160 --> 01:44:10,500
[PAUL MASSICOTTE] Thank you again.

1091
01:44:10,500 --> 01:44:16,960
One technical question, then a more important question.
On a technical side, many countries and provinces...

1092
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:19,900
have sales tax and a couple have income tax.

1093
01:44:19,900 --> 01:44:24,700
For the merchants using your currency,
is there software [for that] already in place?

1094
01:44:24,700 --> 01:44:30,240
I know from a dollar sense, cash registers 
have become pretty sophisticated so that it is...

1095
01:44:30,240 --> 01:44:33,840
easy for them do the accounting to collect the sales tax.

1096
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:38,120
[PAUL MASSICOTTE] Does that already exist? 
[ANDREAS] Absolutely. In fact, it is easier with bitcoin.

1097
01:44:38,120 --> 01:44:41,920
The public ledger provides a complete 
record of all of the transactions,

1098
01:44:41,920 --> 01:44:46,060
as if all of my bank statements from
the first moment I used bitcoin are online.

1099
01:44:46,060 --> 01:44:51,420
I rendered sales tax to the state of California for
the business I ran, selling products via bitcoin.

1100
01:44:51,420 --> 01:44:56,060
I also pay my income taxes in U.S. dollars, 
based on my income which is entirely in bitcoin.

1101
01:44:56,060 --> 01:44:59,380
I do all of my accounting using
traditional accounting software.

1102
01:44:59,380 --> 01:45:03,320
[PAUL MASSICOTTE] And the software is in place
to do the transfers and calculations immediately?

1103
01:45:03,320 --> 01:45:08,420
[ANDREAS] Yes, although it is rather cumbersome
at the moment. The modularities are quite different.

1104
01:45:08,420 --> 01:45:15,280
For example, in traditional banking I have 
a handful of four or five different accounts.

1105
01:45:15,280 --> 01:45:18,280
In bitcoin, I have well over two thousand "accounts."

1106
01:45:18,280 --> 01:45:22,640
With bitcoin it makes sense to create
a new account for every transaction.

1107
01:45:22,640 --> 01:45:28,680
Though they are not really an "account." Therefore,
if you try to put it into the same model, it is difficult.

1108
01:45:28,680 --> 01:45:31,580
However, the software is being developed.

1109
01:45:31,580 --> 01:45:35,020
[PAUL MASSICOTTE] Let me talk to you about-
You basically answered the question, but...

1110
01:45:35,020 --> 01:45:41,420
The way I see it, this is a highly secure
form of anonymous transfer for property.

1111
01:45:41,420 --> 01:45:46,540
You can call it currency, but you are using it now
for a currency from a sense of bartering.

1112
01:45:46,540 --> 01:45:52,900
I presume, it seems to me that this could be very useful
in many things, including exchange of [other] property.

1113
01:45:52,900 --> 01:45:58,920
Today, we have a bunch of lawyers or notaries who
acknowledge the safe transfer of real-estate property.

1114
01:45:58,920 --> 01:46:04,060
But it seems to me this application could 
be used very often in many different facets.

1115
01:46:04,060 --> 01:46:09,620
So let's [look] five years [ahead]. How do you see this
technology being used to the benefit of our society?

1116
01:46:09,620 --> 01:46:11,640
Give me some examples.

1117
01:46:11,640 --> 01:46:18,180
[ANDREAS] There are some very interesting 
applications where the decentralized ledger...

1118
01:46:18,180 --> 01:46:21,800
is used as a public record, of sorts,
for all kinds of [information].

1119
01:46:21,800 --> 01:46:26,780
From registering bicycles,
to automobiles, to company shares.

1120
01:46:26,780 --> 01:46:32,580
Two days ago, I was at a Bitcoin conference where
a couple was married, and had their marriage...

1121
01:46:32,580 --> 01:46:35,180
registered on the blockchain for the first time.

1122
01:46:35,180 --> 01:46:42,220
They used the blockchain as a register of that contract.
You could use it to register titles and deeds for property,

1123
01:46:42,220 --> 01:46:49,480
and transfer those titles and deeds for any form
of property, including vehicles and real-estate.

1124
01:46:49,480 --> 01:46:53,960
With a simple electronic transaction,
you could transfer the deed to a car.

1125
01:46:53,960 --> 01:47:02,100
Even better and more importantly, the car could look up
its own title and render itself usable to the new owner.

1126
01:47:02,100 --> 01:47:05,720
Automatically. This concept is called "smart property,"

1127
01:47:05,720 --> 01:47:10,220
where the property recognizes its ownership
through reference to the blockchain.

1128
01:47:10,220 --> 01:47:15,000
All forms of decentralized registration
can be implemented with the blockchain.

1129
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:22,760
Furthermore, you can issue share certificates or
any other form of token, which can then be traded.

1130
01:47:22,760 --> 01:47:29,660
Sharing my bandwidth and receiving a token in return,
which I can spend to use someone else's bandwidth,

1131
01:47:29,660 --> 01:47:37,700
creating the possibilities for [more] sharing economy
[services], similar to how we have AirBnb or Uber today.

1132
01:47:37,700 --> 01:47:41,680
We can do many of those things using digital tokens.

1133
01:47:41,680 --> 01:47:46,100
There is a company here in Toronto that 
developed an application that allows you --

1134
01:47:46,100 --> 01:47:52,360
upon submitting a transaction on the blockchain
-- to unlock a door for an AirBnb apartment.

1135
01:47:52,360 --> 01:47:56,720
Your smartphone would make the payment 
and then unlock the door to the apartment,

1136
01:47:56,720 --> 01:47:58,720
and have access to that property.

1137
01:47:58,720 --> 01:48:02,460
[PAUL MASSICOTTE] It is amazing.
A minor or secondary question...

1138
01:48:02,460 --> 01:48:06,160
I don't understand why they used the 
blockchain for a couple getting married.

1139
01:48:06,160 --> 01:48:12,580
Is he scared to get mixed up with the wife? 
[Laughter] What is the issue?

1140
01:48:12,580 --> 01:48:20,020
[ANDREAS] So, it was largely symbolic and 
a proof-of-concept. This couple was already married...

1141
01:48:20,020 --> 01:48:22,180
under traditional state laws.

1142
01:48:22,180 --> 01:48:35,360
However, they wanted a record of their marriage that
was publicly accessible, unforgeable, unchangeable.

1143
01:48:35,360 --> 01:48:45,340
It provides a permanent record of what has happened,
a history that is unalterable by anyone within an hour.

1144
01:48:45,340 --> 01:48:48,940
and will be preserved through time.

1145
01:48:48,940 --> 01:48:53,340
[PAUL MASSICOTTE] So the bedroom door
does not open if it is the wrong person? [Laughter]

1146
01:48:53,340 --> 01:48:56,520
Automatic accessing. [Laughter]

1147
01:48:56,520 --> 01:48:59,920
[IRVING GERSTEIN] Our concluding 
question from Senator Greene, please.

1148
01:48:59,920 --> 01:49:01,480
[STEPHEN GREENE] Thank you very much.

1149
01:49:01,480 --> 01:49:09,020
I take your point about the dangers of 
inappropriate or premature regulation.

1150
01:49:09,020 --> 01:49:15,400
We don't know where this is heading,
and the pace of change is [fast].

1151
01:49:15,400 --> 01:49:22,080
I don't think we want to influence the
pace of change or what it might lead to.

1152
01:49:22,080 --> 01:49:26,820
We must write a report which
will have recommendations.

1153
01:49:26,820 --> 01:49:33,260
My question is, what would your reaction be
to a report with just one recommendation,

1154
01:49:33,260 --> 01:49:36,640
and that recommendation would be,
'there should be no regulations [at this time],'

1155
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:44,540
but we will re-visit this in five years?

1156
01:49:44,540 --> 01:49:51,160
[ANDREAS] I think that would be a very good idea.
I think there is some room for clarification.

1157
01:49:51,160 --> 01:49:54,560
For example, the tax status for individuals.

1158
01:49:54,560 --> 01:50:00,460
Or at least clarifying the right of an individual to make
a choice in the currency they use as a consumer,

1159
01:50:00,460 --> 01:50:05,360
and to affirm the legality of using digital 
currencies in all forms of commerce...

1160
01:50:05,360 --> 01:50:08,880
as entirely equivalent with any other national currency.

1161
01:50:08,880 --> 01:50:13,180
Recognizing it is a private
form of barter and transaction.

1162
01:50:13,180 --> 01:50:20,800
Recognizing the corresponding principles, 
which I consider neutral principles, but they are also...

1163
01:50:20,800 --> 01:50:27,520
principles of the Enlightenment: freedom of association,
freedom of expression and conscience.

1164
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:35,280
I think removing ambiguity in that particular arena,
for personal use, would be enormously useful.

1165
01:50:35,280 --> 01:50:39,360
[STEPHEN GREENE] I agree, thank you very much.

1166
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:46,380
[IRVING GERSTEIN] Mr. Antonopoulos,
your reputation preceded your arrival,

1167
01:50:46,380 --> 01:50:54,600
You may recall that in my introductory remarks,
I did not introduce you as 'a' Bitcoin guru.

1168
01:50:54,600 --> 01:50:57,320
but as the Bitcoin guru.

1169
01:50:57,320 --> 01:51:00,020
[ANDREAS] You humble me, Senator.
[IRVING GERSTEIN] I think I could speak...

1170
01:51:00,020 --> 01:51:06,860
on behalf of all members of the committee in saying
that you have more than lived up to that reputation.

1171
01:51:06,860 --> 01:51:15,080
And we greatly appreciate- [Applause] 
Thank you very much. This meeting is concluded.

1172
01:51:15,080 --> 01:51:45,540
[Music]
