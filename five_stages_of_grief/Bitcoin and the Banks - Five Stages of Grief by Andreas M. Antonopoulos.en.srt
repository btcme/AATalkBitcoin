1
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,760
[ORGANISER] The next person we have coming up
is someone I have looked up to for quite a while.

2
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:17,840
Whenever I [need to know] how to explain a problem
in Bitcoin, it is easy to just go through his videos.

3
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,980
He explains things so perfectly.

4
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:27,580
He is the author of 'Mastering Bitcoin,' and
spoke in front of the Canadian Senate recently.

5
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:32,380
It [received] a lot of attention. I'm sure most
of you have taken a look at what he said there.

6
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:39,320
It was an amazing talk. I haven't seen too many senate
hearings, but it was the first time I saw them clapping,

7
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:46,860
with a look on their face like, 'We just 
listened to something really special.'

8
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:53,280
Andreas [Antonopoulos], the author of 
'Mastering Bitcoin' and an amazing speaker.

9
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,480
He is one person that actually has the chance to
change so many minds by speaking to governments,

10
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:05,900
being able to talk in a way that makes things very simple,
[but also] makes people think about it in a positive light.

11
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:25,720
Andreas, come on up! [Applause]
[ANDREAS] Wow, this is amazing for a meetup.

12
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:31,840
I apologise, I didn't realise this was a 
bring-your-own-chair event. [Laughter]

13
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,620
As you see, the others each brought a chair and
even color coordinated, but I forgot to bring mine.

14
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:41,420
I will pace, which will drive
the videographers crazy,

15
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:45,320
but if you have seen my videos,
you know I don't do podiums.

16
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:53,040
So, welcome everyone! This is really exciting,
probably one of the largest meetups I have done.

17
00:01:53,040 --> 00:02:00,940
I think maybe the largest one was in London, but
you are definitely giving them a run for their money.

18
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:08,180
It is really exciting to see all of this energy 
in Canada with cryptocurrencies.

19
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:17,260
A big thanks to my host, Anthony Di Iorio, who organised
this [event at a] lovely space. Let's get started.

20
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:26,940
How many of you are here for the first time, or
been [recently] introduced to Bitcoin? A few people.

21
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:36,000
How many of you are pretty familiar with Bitcoin?
How many of you own bitcoin? [Audience raises hands]

22
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,780
How many of you are coding with Bitcoin?
Alright, fantastic.

23
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:52,640
I want to talk about splitting hairs
and the five stages of grief. [Laughter]

24
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,180
I know you thought I was coming
here to talk about Bitcoin;

25
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:02,260
I want to talk about Bitcoin from the public perception.

26
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:09,960
Three years ago, I would go places and tell 
people about Bitcoin. They had never heard of it.

27
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,240
They didn't know what I was talking about.

28
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:18,650
I wouldn't ask people "have you heard of Bitcoin?"
because that was a silly question to ask.

29
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:26,780
I would say, "Let me tell you about something exciting."
A year later, people started hearing about Bitcoin.

30
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:32,740
If I was in a technology-heavy environment
-- basically, if I was surrounded by geeks --

31
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:36,320
I would ask, "Have you heard of Bitcoin?"

32
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:42,820
Gradually it started getting to the point where
I could ask that question of, say, a taxi driver.

33
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:47,260
Get into a taxi... "Have you heard of Bitcoin?"

34
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:54,420
There was this gradual transition [to] mainstream
awareness and people start hearing about it.

35
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:59,060
Of course, what they're hearing is not:

36
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:06,120
"it is one of the most amazing decentralized
consensus networks and payment systems ever."

37
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:16,640
What they hear about is: "DRUGS ON THE INTERNET!"
[Laughter] "I was at a conference talking about bitcoin,"

38
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,160
you say to the average person the street.

39
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:30,380
They will look at you and take a very subtle but firm step
away, just in case you throw cocaine at them. [Laughter]

40
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:39,080
The mainstream awareness right now is,
we are all a bunch of degenerates, porn addicts,

41
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:44,480
drug users, potentially terrorists, though they're
not sure. It depends. Some of us, certainly.

42
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:50,169
Yeah, in this room! This is the mainstream perception.

43
00:04:50,169 --> 00:04:58,360
This is the first stage: denial.
Denial happens with all innovative technologies.

44
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:06,440
It is that desire to dismiss change, especially
if that change is strange and scary.

45
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:18,419
We were talking about banks recently, and the media.
We are seeing that they've moved from denial to anger.

46
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:27,900
Angry about the terrible things you can do,
because Bitcoin is now all about "funding ISIS."

47
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:36,060
[Laughter] Who here has contributed to ISIS recently?

48
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:44,820
Sorry, I raised my hand there. I pay taxes in the
United States; I don't know if you have noticed,

49
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:53,810
but ISIS is driving M1 Abrams tanks and Humvees
with the American flags hastily sprayed off.

50
00:05:53,810 --> 00:06:02,880
So, strictly speaking, yes: I have funded ISIS through
the U.S. Department of Defense, in U.S. dollars,

51
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,060
by leaving behind a lot of nice equipment, 
pallets of U.S. dollars, and things like that.

52
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:14,340
When I fill up my car [with gas], that money goes
to Saudi Arabia; I fund ISIS that way too, oops!

53
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:20,420
But I'll tell you this: I have never funded ISIS in bitcoin,
so let's keep that straight. [Laughter]

54
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:25,039
That's the kind of question that comes up, right?
We have gone from denial to anger.

55
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,260
Now it is not just "we don't want
to hear about this Bitcoin thing,"

56
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:35,360
because it's strange and possibly young 
people are interested in it. [Laughter]

57
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:43,700
Now it's scary! We need to emphasise the scariness. 
You don't speak about Bitcoin in polite company.

58
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:50,740
"Have you heard about Bit-?" "Oh no, I [will not
become] involved in that kind of stuff!" [Laughter]

59
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:56,480
That's the second stage of grief: anger. 
Now we move into the third stage of grief.

60
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:02,260
This is really exciting, because this is 
where things get really silly and fun.

61
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:11,420
Bargaining. You start off with "Bitcoin is irrelevant."
When Bitcoin refuses to die for three years,

62
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:14,039
so you can't say it is irrelevant anymore.

63
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:20,720
It is worth $10 billion, it is tradeable over 
the internet, people [become] excited about it,

64
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,000
and [launch] start-ups with $500 million in investment.

65
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,280
That doesn't sound irrelevant anymore.

66
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:31,600
You drop that storyline and go to anger, 
where it is not "irrelevant" but "dangerous."

67
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:42,900
Now we move into bargaining. The new line is:
"Well, blockchain technology is really promising."

68
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:49,880
"But bitcoin the currency is just weird and volatile,
you don't want to touch that." We're splitting hairs.

69
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:53,960
This is the third stage of grief: bargaining.

70
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:57,760
This is becoming the meme of 2015.

71
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:04,360
A lot of companies are trying to do
this triangulation, trying to split hairs,

72
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:10,620
trying to say, "We will take the blockchain 
but you can leave that bitcoin stuff behind."

73
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:15,360
"Have you started a Bitcoin research group?" 
"Oh no, we don't do that stuff."

74
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:23,840
"We have a blockchain research group at
our bank, studying  blockchain technology."

75
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:30,260
This is really hilarious. The first thing it reveals is,
they don't really understand Bitcoin.

76
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:38,740
You can't just cleave off the 'blockchain
technology' and say, "This is revolutionary!"

77
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:45,640
Because it is not. 'Blockchain' on its own,
is not revolutionary. What do I mean by that?

78
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:50,400
Some of you are looking at me funny.
Why am I saying the blockchain is not revolutionary?

79
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:59,410
Because the blockchain is a ledger. 
How old are ledgers? Thousands of years old.

80
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:14,160
In fact, the very first writing that we discovered around
the world -- on tablets, stone, papyrus -- are ledgers.

81
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:19,500
If you have a page of papyrus, the very first
page ever created, what do you write on it?

82
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:28,240
You write how many goats your neighbour owes you,
or how many vats of wine you sold to someone.

83
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,440
And that is a ledger. There is nothing 
revolutionary about [ledger] technology.

84
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:38,140
If you summed up all the vats of
wine on the first page of papyrus,

85
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:41,920
and then copied that number to the
top of the second page of papyrus,

86
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,660
you are linking together these "blocks" of transactions.

87
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:52,020
Well, that is a blockchain. It is not really interesting
technology. It has been around for ages.

88
00:09:52,020 --> 00:10:00,920
What is really interesting is a decentralized blockchain.
That is fascinating. A decentralized blockchain,

89
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:12,580
with no central authority, no counter-party 
responsible for recording information.

90
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:24,320
That is astonishingly disruptive and a revolutionary
technology. That [would] change so many industries.

91
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:32,140
But that is not what they are researching in the
'blockchain research department' of a big bank.

92
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:41,320
They are researching is ledgers and trying to say,
"We like this blockchain idea, but can we do it...

93
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:53,720
without any mining, decentralization, open access
protocols, anarchic chaos, ['be your own bank'] crap?"

94
00:10:53,720 --> 00:11:04,540
"Can we just get a blockchain more like Visa?" 
[Laughter] Bargaining, the third stage of grief.

95
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:07,500
What is this grief about?

96
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:24,340
One of the [most] entrenched, monopolistic, exploitative
industries that exists in the world doesn't like disruption.

97
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:31,460
In banking, disruption cuts into the profit margin.

98
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:36,740
Bitcoin is disruptive; Bitcoin is not just a bit disruptive.

99
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:44,040
Bitcoin [doesn't say], "Hey, maybe we [will 
compete with the other] payment networks."

100
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:54,340
Bitcoin isn't like PayPal, which [bankers] co-opted
and gradually morphed into a baby Visa. [Laughter]

101
00:11:54,340 --> 00:12:00,870
Bitcoin refuses to be co-opted in that way,
because it has certain pesky characteristics:

102
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:05,300
decentralization, open access, [open-source] protocols...

103
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:11,300
you know, all the stuff they are trying to cut off and
remove so they can turn it into [another] baby Visa.

104
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:23,940
Bitcoin refuses to go away, despite all the smears, bad
language, and [accusations] of funding ISIS and drugs.

105
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:32,300
Bitcoin is extremely disruptive
in a way we haven't yet realized.

106
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:37,760
Even people who are [interested in] Bitcoin 
don't really understand what is going on here.

107
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:45,100
Let's look back a few years. 
Do you remember the dawn of MP3?

108
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:52,519
I actually heard about MP3 two years before Napster
came out, when it was [still] an obscure [algorithm]...

109
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,680
from the Fraunhofer Institute in Germany.

110
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:02,440
They designed this lossy compression algorithm
that was [very] effective, but I didn't get it.

111
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:08,500
I didn't see that [it would] do anything [interesting].
Gradually, it started eating away at the music industry.

112
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:14,340
With the invention of Napster, it turned every
computer into a desktop music station.

113
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:19,360
Suddenly, the music industry was threatened.

114
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:25,940
They fought Napster, Napster turned into Kazaa,
Kazaa turned into Limewire; they fought Limewire,

115
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:30,259
Limewire turned into Gnutella;
they fought Gnutella and got BitTorrent.

116
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:35,180
Then they gave up. They couldn't fight 
anymore, because it was decentralized.

117
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:44,680
Bitcoin started that way, where BitTorrent 
left off, in the "you can't squash this" mode.

118
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:53,960
MP3 destabilized the music industry. 
[How much is] the music industry [worth], $100 billion?

119
00:13:53,960 --> 00:14:01,920
Peanuts. Apple swallowed it in a couple of years.

120
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:11,120
When Bitcoin starts disrupting the banking industry,
it [will] apply something we call "disintermediation."

121
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:19,760
Disintermediation is when an industry you painstakingly
built over a hundred years, becomes obsolete overnight.

122
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:26,560
Disintermediation is when you and I want to do
something, and someone [offers a service]...

123
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,920
to help us do that thing, but
we don't need them anymore.

124
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:37,560
When you [have] disintermediation in the music industry,
it cuts record labels out of the sweet deals,

125
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:45,760
[but] it allows customers to work directly with artists,
and the record companies do not like that.

126
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,920
But that is still a little industry [in comparison].

127
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,600
When we start disintermediating
the financial services industry,

128
00:14:52,600 --> 00:15:03,240
entire multi-billion dollar layers
will evaporate overnight.

129
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:15,740
Bitcoin is incredibly disruptive because of all those
little things they pretend are not really important.

130
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:25,260
What comes after bargaining? Depression. [Laughter]

131
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:35,920
It is a great word, because financial depression already
happened in 2008. I think we are about to see a replay.

132
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:42,280
The financial industry [will not be ready for] this fight.

133
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:52,380
They are going in leveraged up to their eyeballs,
with the worst reputation in two hundred years.

134
00:15:52,380 --> 00:16:00,340
Everyone under 18 years old thinks that 
banks are the worst thing ever invented,

135
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:08,100
and are responsible for stealing their jobs
-- because they did.

136
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:15,100
When you have an entire generation that hates you,
exactly the generation that [will] adopt this technology,

137
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:22,980
and you go into this fight leveraged up to 
your eyeballs, depression sets in pretty quickly.

138
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:29,020
Some of the banks [will] be smarter
and skip right over to acceptance.

139
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:33,490
We saw this with the Internet.
At first, everyone was banding together.

140
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:39,779
The phone companies said, "We will not let this
thing eat our long-distance market!" [Laughter]

141
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:47,700
I remember when I used to call home
to Greece from my college in London.

142
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:55,780
To [have] a ten-minute conversation,
I would literally [need] a stack of coins...

143
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:59,920
and feed them into the meter every ten seconds or so.

144
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:08,580
My entire family would line up on the other end of the
call and parade themselves in front of the telephone:

145
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:13,600
"Hello Andreas, this is Uncle John. How are you?" 
"Very well, thank you." "Yes, here's your Auntie Maria."

146
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:21,340
"Oh, hello Maria..." and so on, fifteen seconds per person,
carefully allocated, moving [down] the line.

147
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:30,940
Keep the line moving, people! Because I just
spent £8 to make a fifteen minute phone call.

148
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:35,100
When I testified in front of the
Australian Senate, they said,

149
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:44,080
"This [was] really difficult to arrange [but] we thank you
for speaking to us from such a great distance today."

150
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,320
My last words to the Australian Senate were:

151
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:51,760
"Just remember, phone companies didn't write the rules
for the internet, and that is why I could do this today."

152
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,500
Because trust me, if phone companies
had written the rules for the Internet,

153
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:01,700
there would be a little slot inside of my Mac Air
and I would need to feed quarters into it...

154
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:10,280
[Laughter] every ten seconds during the Skype calls
I make, just to preserve the long-distance market.

155
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:14,420
When that was happening, eventually some 
companies decided they [would] break ranks,

156
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:18,840
and turn themselves into internet service providers.

157
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:31,080
This [will] be a lot harder to do in the banking industry.
Bitcoin is a very difficult and bitter pill to swallow.

158
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:41,680
The idea that banks [will] simply 'do a bit of blockchain'
and fight this disruption, is ludicrous on its face.

159
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:46,020
'Doing a bit of blockchain' doesn't
serve the other six billion [unbanked].

160
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:54,520
'Doing a bit of blockchain' doesn't unleash the torrent
of innovation that comes with open-access protocols.

161
00:18:54,520 --> 00:19:03,020
Most importantly, 'a bit of blockchain' with a centralized
counter-party in the middle of every transaction...

162
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:10,780
takes us right back to the world we live in today,
where control over money is control over freedom...

163
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:14,500
and most of the world lives as slaves.

164
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:28,120
Bitcoin [will] change that. Thank you. [Applause]
