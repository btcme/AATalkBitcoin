00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,900
[ORGANISER] Andreas Antonopoulos! [Applause]

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:11,460
[ANDREAS] It is such a huge pleasure to be here today.
This is such a great community.

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,540
Everyone here welcomed me with such 
warmth and open arms, so thank you!

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,360
Thank you so much for having me here tonight.

5
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:29,180
I would like to talk about a couple important
issues [regarding] regulatory legitimacy.

6
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:39,940
The cryptocurrency space can achieve compliance
with the payment card industry (PCI) standard...

7
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:44,780
and Sarbanes-Oxley's Public Company 
Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB).

8
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:51,600
[We can incorporate] 'Know-Your-Customer' (KYC)
and the anti-money laundering (AML) rules,

9
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:59,500
which will allow us to achieve legitimacy with
bankers and [gain] our position on the world stage...

10
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:08,700
as a trusted, legitimate currency. [Laughter] [Applause]

11
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:17,540
Eh, fuck that! [Laughter [Applause] No, I don't want
to talk about that. Who wants to talk about that?

12
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:34,840
[That stuff] is ridiculous. We don't need any legitimacy.
We are having fun. We deal with more serious issues.

13
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:43,420
There are a lot of serious people in Wall Street:
dour faced, boring, soulless, parasitic people...

14
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:46,260
wearing suits and ties.

15
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:58,160
Guess what? They stole trillions of dollars and got away
with it. Who needs their legitimacy? [Applause]

16
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:02,040
I want to talk about things that are warm to my heart.

17
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:07,660
Some of you may have heard the talks I have
given recently, about currency as a language.

18
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:11,120
Has anyone here heard some of those talks?

19
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:21,960
Not many people, great. It will all sound brand new
to you, a great opportunity for me to repeat myself.

20
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:28,280
What I care about is charity and the other six billion.

21
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:35,640
There are a billion people in this world who have
access to bank accounts without currency controls,

22
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:46,540
that can transmit money in international markets
and access deep pools of liquid credit for loans.

23
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:50,600
[That is] us, the rich people of the Western world.

24
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:56,600
Then there is the other six billion people worn
all around the world who have limited bank accounts...

25
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,480
or no bank accounts at all.

26
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,320
People who live on $1 per day if they are lucky.

27
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:11,080
People who have no access to international markets,
no access to international finance, no access to loans.

28
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,700
No access to opportunity.

29
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:22,200
I would like to think that I am a really smart guy who
got here because of efforts I made throughout my life,

30
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,540
but we all know that is bullshit.

31
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,940
I got here through an accident of birth,

32
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:33,140
which put me in a white middle-class society
of the developed nation of Greece.

33
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:40,860
As a child of professional, educated parents,
I was swimming with current all the way.

34
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:49,320
There are hundreds of thousands of people smarter
than me, dying of diphtheria somewhere in the world.

35
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:57,400
I care about what we could do with cryptocurrencies
to bring economic development and inclusion.

36
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:06,020
[I care about] bringing the other six billion [people] into
a world economy without borders, political corruption,

37
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:18,500
and massive theft by parasitic banks. [Applause]

38
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:23,360
And it starts with charity at a very basic level.

39
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,760
This community [speaks about] charity more
than any other cryptocurrency community.

40
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:34,960
Thank you so much for leading the way and [being]
an example of what we can do with cryptocurrency,

41
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,860
when we think [about] doing good.

42
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:40,020
That is what is amazing about this community.

43
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:47,020
Bitcoin has a lot of charity too. We have achieved some
amazing things in the Bitcoin space [through charity].

44
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:55,300
About a month and a half ago, Newsweek destroyed
the life of an innocent old man called Dorian Nakamoto,

45
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:59,400
by saying that he was the creator of this currency.

46
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:07,180
I started a fundraiser; within six hours, we raised
more than thirty bitcoin for Dorian, Nakamoto.

47
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:14,080
Now, we have raised almost fifty bitcoin
to help this man put his life together [again].

48
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:23,240
At the same time, Sean's Outpost, one of my favourite
major charities, distributed sixty-five thousand meals...

49
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,460
for the homeless of Pensacola, Florida in the last year.

50
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:30,300
[They] tapped into Bitcoin and used it to raise
money from people all around the world.

51
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:38,800
If people care, they can now send money anywhere
in the world to support the charity of their choice.

52
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:53,000
[Applause] When there was a typhoon in the Philippines,
Fr33aid raised money and set over $5,000 within a day.

53
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,640
[The money went] right on the ground where it mattered,
where it could make a difference in people's lives...

54
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:09,640
without having to worry about regulations, [slow]
wire transfers, or giving Western Union a 20% cut.

55
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:15,960
All of these charities take [bitcoin as]
a currency and turning it into a force for good.

56
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,620
But that is only the beginning.

57
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:25,840
We have the opportunity to subvert and improve
some of the most exploited markets in the world.

58
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:31,300
The first one I care about a lot is
the international remittances market.

59
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:38,460
Every year, poor people in the developed world who
are migrants and have jobs as itinerant workers...

60
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:46,700
[They are mostly] Mexicans here in the United States;
Indians in different places like Dubai, for construction...

61
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:53,980
They send money home to their families abroad.
$500 billion [in total] primarily goes to four countries:

62
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:59,520
Mexico, the Philippines, Indonesia, and India.

63
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:09,180
That $500 billion is a lot more than what we
in the developed world send in terms of financial aid.

64
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:14,620
Approximately $175 billion has been sent
by our governments to the developing world.

65
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:20,360
Guess where that money goes? [Financial aid] from
our government goes to the top of their governments...

66
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,540
and then trickles down.

67
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:30,200
Only about 5% actually reaches the people in need
because the rest is taken through corruption.

68
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:39,220
Meanwhile, out of the $500 billion sent through
remittances, $75 billion is collected as fees...

69
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:41,300
by companies like Western Union.

70
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:49,100
They charge anywhere from 5% to more than 25% on the
money that people are sending home to their families.

71
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:55,840
That is $75 billion [taken] out of the pockets of the
poorest people on this planet. We can change that.

72
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,680
We can change that right now.

73
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:05,280
Cryptocurrencies enable flows of money from
the developed nations to the developing world,

74
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:10,240
to give back that $75 billion
to the people who need it most.

75
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,720
If you take that money [back] and put it in 
the pockets of the poorest people in the world,

76
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:20,160
specifically the pockets of women who
run the finances in their communities,

77
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:26,960
[receiving] money from their husbands and family
members abroad, they will convert every single dollar...

78
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:32,680
[into improving] water [access],
sanitation, education, and healthcare.

79
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:40,400
They have an immediate impact that reaches very far in
their own community. That is how we change the world.

80
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:54,220
That is what we can do with cryptocurrencies.
That is what I care about. [Applause]

81
00:08:54,220 --> 00:09:02,400
One of the questions I have been thinking about for the
last year is, how do altcoins behave against each other?

82
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:08,620
Whether they are in competition or not.
The underlying question is one of scarcity.

83
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:15,000
A lot of people think other coins compete directly
with bitcoin, and if there are too many coins,

84
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,920
that dilutes the value and
digital scarcity created by bitcoin.

85
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:27,460
I think that is a very old fashioned way to look at
currency. We think of currency that way because...

86
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:30,560
Throughout our lives, we have grown up in a world...

87
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:36,080
of national sovereign currencies that
exist in a monopolistic zero-sum game.

88
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:43,300
Winning for my currency and my nation is
a zero-sum game against [another nation's] currency.

89
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:51,200
All these currencies exhibit a [geo-political] monopoly.
If I live in the United States, I am born into U.S. dollars.

90
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:57,320
I don't have a choice. I must pay my taxes in U.S. dollars,
and that is the currency I will use [while I'm there].

91
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:01,960
Well, [some of] that is no longer the case. 
[Because of Bitcoin], currency is now a choice.

92
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:12,960
With these digital currencies created by individuals, we
can now choose any currency we want to interact with.

93
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:22,620
In making that choice, we also choose our community
and the currency which best represents our values.

94
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:26,940
[That choice] is more powerful
than any vote in the world.

95
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:33,920
Let's think about what it means to choose
a currency and how that currency derives value.

96
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:41,600
We need to re-think the word. Currency used to be
defined by the authority of the sovereign who created it.

97
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:47,840
The sovereign who created the currency would
put the force and monopoly of the state behind it...

98
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:52,100
to give it value, and that is what
gave currency value in the old world.

99
00:10:52,100 --> 00:11:01,320
In this world, a cryptocurrency with a funny dog [as its
mascot] has value. Why? Because it has value to you.

100
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:06,860
You give it value by using that currency.

101
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:11,700
What happens in ten or fifteen years as
cryptocurrencies become more widespread?

102
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:16,880
How do you look at value in a world
where anybody can create a currency?

103
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:22,300
What does it mean if, someday,
you [travel to] a rural environment in Africa,

104
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:25,520
which is predominantly using two currencies:

105
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:35,940
one has a funny dog, and the other has
an old white woman named Elizabeth.

106
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:41,040
Well, I can tell you something. The people in
that village probably don't know who Elizabeth is.

107
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:48,740
They will certainly have no clue what the hell
that dog is and why its eyes look like that. [Laughter]

108
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:53,880
What they do know: you could use either 
one of these currencies to buy six eggs.

109
00:11:53,880 --> 00:12:01,900
That is all that matters. If a currency is useful as a
means of exchange, then that currency has value.

110
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:10,740
You can have a thousand economists write a thousand
PhD papers that tell you exactly why it's not a currency.

111
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:15,640
But if you can buy six eggs, then it is
a currency and nothing else matters.

112
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:22,040
What is the fundamental difference between currencies
if they have monetary value at the point of purchase?

113
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:30,500
If they can be used to exchange for goods and services
by people in a community who will use that currency?

114
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:37,200
Well, one of the currencies has a predictable,
deterministic, fixed monetary supply.

115
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:42,700
The other currency has an old white lady
on the front. That is the only difference.

116
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:48,720
They sure as hell didn't pick that currency 
and they don't know why Elizabeth is on it.

117
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:57,740
Maybe she won a popularity contest.
Well, so did the dog. [Laughter]

118
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:02,500
We now live in the world where
currency acquires value through its use.

119
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:10,240
If you can transact internationally with a currency,
the only thing that matters is how many people use it,

120
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,020
and how they use that currency.

121
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:17,860
If they use that currency, that gives it value, by definition.

122
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:27,200
How do we survive in that kind of world where value
is determined purely by adoption, not by a sovereign.

123
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,720
Not by the regulations that back it,
but by the algorithms that run it.

124
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:37,680
Not by trust in the central authority with the 
ability to print as much money as it wants,

125
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:43,620
who hands that money over at 0% interest to
the biggest banks, in trickle-down economics.

126
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:48,960
By algorithms that are predictable, 
deterministic, and remove uncertainty.

127
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:55,020
By algorithms that allow us to see
how the currency will develop over time.

128
00:13:55,020 --> 00:14:02,600
In that world, adoption is the only thing that matters.
We don't know how to live in that world.

129
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:07,720
That world hasn't come yet,
but I think it is coming and coming fast.

130
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:15,620
I think the idea of [only having 180 national] currencies
will seem quaint in a couple of decades.

131
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:22,680
In fact, until recently, I thought we would only have
a couple hundred altcoins, and I changed my mind.

132
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,760
Guess what? I am often wrong.

133
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:31,280
But when I get new facts, I form new opinions,
because the old opinions don't fit the facts anymore.

134
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:39,220
As I saw the explosion of alternative currencies,
which in itself is a somewhat patronizing [term]...

135
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:45,980
As I saw the development of altcoins, I realized
that we will not just have hundreds of currencies.

136
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:52,440
Let's do a quick poll. How many of you think that,
in a decade, we will have hundreds of coins?

137
00:14:52,440 --> 00:15:02,260
Thousands? Tens of thousands?
Hundreds of thousands? Millions?

138
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:05,240
All right, now we are having a conversation.

139
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:10,780
What does it mean to live in the world with
hundreds of thousands or millions of currencies?

140
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:16,420
The key realization came when I saw a website
that allowed me to build a cryptocurrency...

141
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:23,520
by entering a name and monetary policy from
a drop-down box in a web form, and [clicking] 'submit.'

142
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,620
You needed to pay about $50 to do that,

143
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:31,840
but I guarantee that by the end of the year, 
you will be able to do that for free.

144
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:40,920
Then I realized that everybody will do it. 
At a very basic level, currency is a language.

145
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,380
Currency is a means of expression.

146
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:47,440
Currency is the language by which
we communicate value to each other.

147
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,820
Currency is an emergent artifact of a social species.

148
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:58,640
Let me repeat that: currency is an 
emergent artifact of a social species.

149
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:05,800
How do you know that? Observe five year-olds.

150
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:13,500
Go into a primary school, watch how five-year-olds
behave. They don't have currency, so they invent it.

151
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:22,800
They invent currency as soon as they develop
social bonds within a broad social environment.

152
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:32,920
If you go into a primary school, you will see children
trading cards, Pokémon, Tamagotchi, rubber bands,

153
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:38,560
candy, cafeteria credits, whatever.

154
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:43,140
It is not unlike a prison, in many ways. [Laughter]

155
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,780
The only difference is, they don't
allow them to have cigarettes.

156
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:49,840
Otherwise, that would be the predominant currency.

157
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:56,420
But they do allow them to have doughnuts; 
in many schools, that is the predominant currency.

158
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:06,260
Currency emerges in social environments because
it is used by individuals to express value, appreciation,

159
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:15,960
to express popularity and strengthen
social bonds, to create social experiences.

160
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:20,420
That is what currency does.
Trade is a social interaction.

161
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:25,500
Currency is the language that allows us
to have that social interaction.

162
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:33,100
When children are able to create currency, 
that means everyone can create currency.

163
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:41,380
There will be a JoeyCoin competing with MariaCoin
in the primary school, in a battle of popularity.

164
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:50,160
Yes, there will be. There will be BieberCoin and
MetallicaCoin. You can see how old I am. [Laughter]

165
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:56,200
Maybe AndreasCoin. I will pre-mine the hell out of it.

166
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:07,240
There will be coins of all types, representing brands,
corporations, your local mall, used as a loyalty card.

167
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:16,000
There will be coins representing bands and silly memes.
I am at a conference for one of those [right now].

168
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:23,200
It doesn't matter. All of these coins
may or may not have [some value].

169
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:28,880
But realize that there is a big difference between
monetary value and [other forms of value].

170
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:37,120
The vast majority of the tens of thousands of coins
which may exist, will have no monetary value.

171
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:46,200
You can try telling Joey that his coin doesn't have
[monetary] value; it has value to Joey and his friends.

172
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:54,360
It can be used to express popularity in a social market.
It has value to the followers of [Justin] Bieber.

173
00:18:54,360 --> 00:19:03,960
In some cases, it may [be more valuable] than some of
the national currencies out there, if he ever launches it.

174
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:09,200
How do we live in the world where there are hundreds
of thousands of coins, and most of them have no value?

175
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,000
We disassociate value from authority.

176
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:18,960
We understand that value does not derive from
who created it, but only from who is using it.

177
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,260
We already live in that world in terms of information.

178
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:30,560
We used to [read] published opinion as being
authoritative if it came from a publisher...

179
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:35,640
with a giant printing press and a fancy name,
like the New York Times.

180
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:40,560
Then we [transitioned] to a world where 
everyone on the street could publish an opinion.

181
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:45,800
We needed to revise our understanding of 
authority, because it no longer fit the facts.

182
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:53,960
Sometimes, people from very esteemed institutions like
the New York Times, such as "journalist" Judith Miller,

183
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:57,680
lie about weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) in Iraq,

184
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:01,940
[a lie which] kills hundreds of thousands of people.

185
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:10,320
Sometimes, an Egyptian blogger, a nobody, tells the truth
about the regime of Mubarak, because they are there.

186
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:18,120
We live in a world where [value] comes from the content,
not from the authority of the printing press.

187
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,780
And now we just did that to currency.

188
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:27,740
Currency gains [value] not because
of who created it, but by who uses it.

189
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:33,800
In a few decades, you might be surprised about
which currency [achieved] monetary value status.

190
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,280
It will be a very grey line.

191
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:46,520
I think we will see currencies that suddenly erupt,
capture the imagination of an entire community,

192
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,100
and then acquire value.

193
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:53,360
I have some bad news, the other way [this] could go.

194
00:20:53,360 --> 00:21:00,480
Some of these currencies will have monetary
value and then fade into nothingness again.

195
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:06,860
A bubbling cauldron full of currencies where some
rise to the surface, and then sink down quickly.

196
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:12,120
Some stay afloat [for the long term].
I think Bitcoin will be one of the powerful ones.

197
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,780
I'm not sure about Dogecoin yet,
but it is looking pretty promising.

198
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:23,440
I think it is very interesting how this community
demonstrated to the world what marketing can do,

199
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:28,240
by having a positive and charitable spirit.

200
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,520
That is the new world I think we will
live in, within a couple of decades.

201
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,820
It will be a very interesting world.

202
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:42,680
That is what I wanted to talk about today, the role of
currency as language and form of societal [expression].

203
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:50,060
Thank you so much! [Applause]
