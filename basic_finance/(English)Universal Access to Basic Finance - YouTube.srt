1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,420
Thank you for coming today.
The title of my talk is a misdirection.

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:10,740
"Thoughts on the Future of Programmable Money"
is just the generic title for every talk I give,

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,320
and then I change it just before I go on stage.

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,480
This is all improvisation, folks.

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:27,800
I will be talking about universal basic finance.
That is the topic of my talk today.

6
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,180
At the moment, we are at a crossroads.

7
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:39,860
We are having a great debate about
the future of cryptocurrency and finance.

8
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:47,600
A lot of people are expressing some
very strong opinions, myself included.

9
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:56,620
The backdrop to all of this, are the people who aren't
in this room and will never be in a room like this.

10
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:04,180
In 2013, I visited the beautiful country of Argentina
for the first time, and gave a talk in Buenos Aires.

11
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:11,640
It completely changed the direction and trajectory
of my involvement in Bitcoin and open blockchains.

12
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:21,080
For the first time, I didn't need to explain the "why" of
Bitcoin, open blockchains, and freedom in finance.

13
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:29,140
Everybody there was interested in only one 
question: how do I [get involved] right now?

14
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:35,600
Because the "why" is already
obvious to people from Argentina.

15
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,480
Someone came up to me at the conference 
and said, "You have inspired me today."

16
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,040
"I was [almost too] terrified to come to this conference."

17
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:47,460
"I am afraid of what might happen
if our government changes again."

18
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:51,760
"My grandparents were kidnapped
by the previous regime."

19
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:56,680
"We didn't see them for months and thought
they had been thrown out of an airplane."

20
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,900
Think about that for a second.

21
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:04,780
When we talk about financial inclusion,
we talk about the banked and unbanked.

22
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:11,480
But we have no clue, from our position
of privilege, what this really means.

23
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,460
It shook me to the core.

24
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:19,960
I have had conversations like that every 
year since I started working in this space.

25
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:28,080
People will come to me and say,
"I hear you, because that is my story too."

26
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,460
What does it mean to be unbanked?

27
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:41,900
The World Bank defines "unbanked" as 2.5 billion people
who have absolutely no access to financial services...

28
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,440
and live in cash-based societies.

29
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:48,540
Conveniently, they only count heads of household.

30
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:53,480
Spouses and children are
unimportant in this calculation.

31
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:58,460
Only the primary earners matter.

32
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:05,700
Yet we know that in the vast majority of the world, [day-
to-day] household finances are controlled by women.

33
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:10,720
But they are not counted as the head of household.

34
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,000
To be unbanked is not to simply
[live in] a cash-based society.

35
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:24,260
To be unbanked is to lack connectivity to
the world, to lack the ability to participate...

36
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:33,920
in trade and commerce, to [be unable] to get
a job and [find] people who want your services.

37
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:40,980
[To struggle] to build a future for your children.
It is to be condemned to poverty.

38
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:46,140
When we look at [those conditions], we think,
'They don't have money, that's why they're unbanked.'

39
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:52,010
Wrong. Absolutely wrong.

40
00:03:52,010 --> 00:04:01,300
They don't have access, documentation, or
the necessary literacy to fill in an application form.

41
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:09,380
Sometimes they don't even have the clothes,
shoes, or appearance to be able to enter a bank...

42
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:13,860
without being kicked out by a security guard.

43
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:17,320
That is what it means to be unbanked.

44
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,340
What does that do?

45
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:28,030
It creates enormous poverty around the world
just so we can persist in this petty, bourgeois idea...

46
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:39,160
idea that as long as every participant must
prove their identity, we can track every transaction...

47
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:44,120
through this surveillance system and end crime.

48
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:51,340
By believing in that false idea of
safety through totalitarian control,

49
00:04:51,340 --> 00:05:03,160
we condemn billions of people to poverty.
Not just 2.5 billion, but many more.

50
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:10,620
We talk about financial inclusion from the perspective
of the rich and privileged world we live in.

51
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,840
The world I live in.

52
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:20,120
As an American citizen, I can not only open
a bank account, but trade in multiple currencies...

53
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:25,870
without restrictions and access investment
opportunities all around the world.

54
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:29,140
Capital, liquidity, and credit.

55
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:36,400
A stable currency that won't destroy itself
overnight, taking my entire savings with it.

56
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:44,370
Hopefully, most of the time, institutions
that are not actively stealing my money...

57
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:52,040
or [rapidly] destroying the currency in order
to pay off their debt through hyperinflation,

58
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,960
leading to financial collapse.

59
00:05:55,970 --> 00:06:02,200
How many people have that?
Everyone in this room, probably.

60
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:06,790
But if you count people around the world
with access to that level of financial services,

61
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:09,860
it is maybe 1.5 billion people.

62
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:22,140
After 2013, that is why I started saying strongly
and loudly, "This is about the other six billion."

63
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:27,300
That is what financial inclusion means.

64
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:34,300
Our regulatory system is actively
excluding people from finance.

65
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:45,700
We have finally reached a point where access
to basic financial services is a privilege.

66
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:54,260
The average person must do a dance to 
prove themselves worthy in front of a banker,

67
00:06:54,260 --> 00:07:04,820
filling in reams of paperwork and application forms,
to be granted the privilege of financial services.

68
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:13,660
We are even condemning cash: the ultimate
peer-to-peer, anonymous, fungible mechanism...

69
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:22,300
that has provided basic financial
services to everyone for millenia.

70
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:27,900
Cash has one fatal flaw, which is not that
it is anonymous - that is its greatest feature.

71
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,460
It is not that it can be used by criminals,
because the real criminals get a banking license...

72
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:40,580
and defraud people by the millions.

73
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:46,350
It is available to everyone without vetting.

74
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:54,960
It is an open, transparent, neutral, verifiable,
peer-to-peer transactional system.

75
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:01,699
But its greatest weakness is, it is constrained
by geopgraphy and locality.

76
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:05,700
It doesn't have enough range and scale.

77
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:17,200
Now we have a new form of digital cash,
which is also open, neutral, verifiable, unforgeable,

78
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,080
and transportable.

79
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:27,800
This one is also borderless, censorship resistant,
and can be used even when your government

80
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,640
doesn't want it.

81
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:34,720
It [does not require] privilege or identity.

82
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:39,080
It can be used everywhere in
the world, by whoever wants to,

83
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:47,940
by simply downloading the software on 
whatever computing device they can afford.

84
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,920
That is the real revolution here.

85
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:57,540
While we have our little privileged discussions
about whether we should regulate cryptocurrencies,

86
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:02,200
how much we should regulate cryptocurrencies,
and who should regulate cryptocurrencies...

87
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:08,500
Fuck that! [Applause]

88
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:14,760
Cryptocurrencies are about providing universal
[access to] basic finance, to whomever needs it,

89
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:19,540
everywhere in the world,
whether we like them or not.

90
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:27,050
What will people do with universal basic finance?
They will do what they have done for millenia with cash.

91
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:31,080
They will build a future for their children.

92
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:40,480
We are paralyzed with fear because of a few
bad actors, blind to the fact that worst actors...

93
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:49,760
have state privilege and endorsements, hand-in-hand
with intelligence agencies, inside the mechanisms...

94
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,060
of surveillance capitalism.

95
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:59,020
They fund dictators and drug lords all 
around the world with our tax money,

96
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:02,300
to the tune of trillions [of dollars].

97
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:08,700
The real terrorism and drug financing doesn't
happen in petty cash [or cryptocurrency];

98
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:17,160
it happens through millions of barrels of
oil and U.S. dollar wire transfers, by banks...

99
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:21,460
who get caught again and again.

100
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:31,440
They will pay a fine that is worth a fraction of
their profit or the tens of thousands of deaths...

101
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,260
they have contributed to.

102
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:36,720
Not a single person goes to jail.

103
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:48,000
Some people still have the audacity to say
that we must end cash in order to stop crime.

104
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:54,170
How magnificently self-righteous.

105
00:10:54,170 --> 00:11:01,029
In the United States, about 18% of the population
does not have access to banking services.

106
00:11:01,029 --> 00:11:03,700
That is 60 million people.

107
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:09,600
Once, when I recited this fact at a banking
conference, a lady in the bank raised her hand...

108
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:18,300
and asked, "Why should we
give bank accounts to illegals?"

109
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:22,400
That is a chilling question to ask,

110
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:27,200
but let me translate it to you in words
that will have more of an impact.

111
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:36,320
"Those people don't deserve the
privilege of financial inclusion."

112
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:44,680
When your neighbor says, "Those people don't
belong in our neighborhood," it might freak you out.

113
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:49,240
You suddenly realize that you are living next to a bigot.

114
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:56,990
But when this banking regulator asked, 
"Why should we give bank accounts to illegals,"

115
00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:09,540
I calmly responded, "You shouldn't. We will." [Applause]

116
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:18,260
At the last conference I attended, after I gave my speech
decrying the lack of security and financial inclusion,

117
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:27,120
a young man in his 20s came up to me and said,
"This really spoke to my personal story."

118
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:35,580
He had been living in western, developed countries
for the past fifteen years, and has not been...

119
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:40,240
able to open a bank account.

120
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:47,850
"Every time I write my name and place of birth
in the application, the process has already ended."

121
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:58,320
"I was born in Iran. I didn't choose that.
I haven't done anything [wrong]."

122
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,460
"I have a job and I pay my taxes."

123
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:15,240
"All I want is to deposit my paycheck and buy groceries.
For fifteen years, I've been unable to do that."

124
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,000
This is the face of the unbanked.

125
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:25,460
They are walking the streets around you, in this
city of privilege, the independent district of London,

126
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:28,460
bought and paid for by banking corporations.

127
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:34,820
This enclave is the Vatican of capitalism,
a citiy within a city.

128
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:42,100
Invisible people such as janitors and service
professionals making your sandwiches,

129
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,760
who don't have a bank account.

130
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:52,780
They must take their cash paycheck
to various places for payday loans.

131
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:58,540
Maybe they accept checks or other
forms of payment they can't deposit.

132
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:06,520
They are charged 10-30% to send money home to their
loved ones and support a basic subsistence lifestyle.

133
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,840
That is the unbanked, right here in this city.

134
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:18,980
Don't imagine the great masses in Africa, South America,
or southeast Asia; of course they are unbanked.

135
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:22,020
They are right here.
They are your neighbors.

136
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:30,300
They are forced to live in that position so we can
continue [believing in] the illusion that safety comes...

137
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:34,280
from totalitarian surveillance.

138
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:40,600
This very conference is being sponsored by
a company that is spreading around millions of dollars...

139
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,500
worth of marketing [for] surveillance [tools].

140
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:47,620
They are promoting and advancing the state-of-the-art.

141
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:51,170
You all have their name on your badge,
look down and check it out.

142
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:59,900
This company shares and sells your data
to other companies, which further process...

143
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,840
that data to intelligence agencies.

144
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:10,420
This lovely trickle-down surveillance eventually
reaches some regime that enjoys cutting up...

145
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:13,620
the bodies of journalists with hacksaws.

146
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:21,040
Don't fool yourself: it is not possible to separate
your position within a company like that...

147
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,260
from the moral implications of your actions.

148
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:30,740
I say to all of you, when you are hiring people
and see [such a company] on their resume,

149
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:39,280
just like if I saw companies like General
Dynamics, Raytheon, and Lockhead Martin...

150
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:44,620
[If they worked for] any company in our space
that is actively pursuing surveillance technology...

151
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:51,480
and selling [our data] to the highest bidder, 
they have declared moral bankruptcy.

152
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:56,589
If you declare moral bankruptcy, you should
have to spend at least seven years struggling...

153
00:15:56,589 --> 00:16:02,780
to find a job and being interrogated about your ethics.

154
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:12,839
Just like poor people are forced to spend
seven years trying to prove to a banker...

155
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:18,360
that they deserve the privilege of banking.

156
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:24,160
We have some deep moral choices to make.
We stand at a crossroads right now.

157
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:30,660
World governments are trying to abolish cash,
the very last lifeline that remains...

158
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:35,380
for billions of poor people.

159
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:38,820
It is not because they don't work;
they work harder than all of us.

160
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,440
It is not because they don't deserve [better].

161
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:50,980
It is because of where they born, the documentation
or literacy they don't have, and how they look.

162
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:55,500
In Saudi Arabia, women are not allowed
to own property and bank accounts.

163
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,959
This is the case in half a dozen
countries around the world.

164
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:04,860
We look at that and say, "Shame on them
That is immoral. That is disgusting."

165
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:09,939
Then we turn around and do the same thing
to immigrants in this country. And my country.

166
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,740
I am part British, part American.

167
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:19,640
I need to apologise [to dozens] of countries
around the world the moment I arrive.

168
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:29,540
I know in my heart that every time I pay taxes,
I am killing thousands of people by proxy.

169
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:35,890
I still pay, because I am also helping people on welfare.

170
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:44,880
When we make these moral choices, we need
to understand that surveillance never stopped crime.

171
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:55,660
Surveillance is the license that gives 
control to people at the top of they system.

172
00:17:55,660 --> 00:18:00,960
They will commit crimes, the worst of crimes.

173
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:07,830
I know Britain doesn't use the metric system,
so "mega-" is the prefix we use for millions.

174
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:17,580
For example, a mega-crime is where you [fraudulently]
foreclose a million homes and don't go to jail.

175
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:26,280
We perform surveillance and analytics to catch
petty drug dealers selling pot for bitcoin,

176
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:33,850
but who is surveilling [the actions of] Lockhead Martin?
On the money laundering banks? Nobody.

177
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:37,090
Do you know why? None of them will ever go to jail.

178
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:39,600
The regulators are completely captured.

179
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:46,840
This is a system of controlling all finance
from above, with levers of power...

180
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:56,240
over the lives of millions and billions of people, cutting
off entire countries because "they're under sanction."

181
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,720
They are not privileged enough, they are not
"people" enough to gain financial services.

182
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,400
Guess who that system attracts?

183
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:10,030
If you build levers of power like that, the very
worst sociopaths in our society are attracted,

184
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:12,820
like flies to shit.

185
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:20,050
They will grab hold of those levers of power and
destroy all of your freedoms as quickly as they can.

186
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:27,870
We have built societies in which one
bad election could be the last election.

187
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:35,040
If you don't believe me, look at what has
happened in Turkey, Russia, and Venezuela,

188
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:41,260
capturing billions of people around the world every day.

189
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:47,720
Let me end on a positive note, because you
are probably a bit freaked out by all of this.

190
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:52,020
You should be. This is serious stuff.

191
00:19:52,020 --> 00:20:03,620
Open, public, borderless, transparent, neutral,
censorship resistant, and private cryptocurrencies exist.

192
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:09,620
They will not be regulated; they cannot be regulated.

193
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:17,260
Not by committees, only by
mathematics and algorithms.

194
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:27,340
They provide certainty, programmable consumer
protection, and reputation management.

195
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:31,940
They provide access without identity.

196
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:44,480
Eventually, they will give billions of people not
just a bank account in their pocket, but a bank.

197
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:52,760
They will democratize the functions of banking,
as applications that anyone can access without vetting.

198
00:20:52,760 --> 00:21:02,940
They are pre-vetted by agreeing to download
software which follows the rules of consensus.

199
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:16,340
That is the only vetting required in these systems.
"But we shouldn't allow that!" We did.

200
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:23,020
"But we can't have people make 
anonymous transactions!" They will.

201
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:31,180
"But we must regulate this!"
You can't. And you won't.

202
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:34,780
Six billion people need this.

203
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:45,020
You have neither the moral authority nor 
the practical capability to stand in their way.

204
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:52,559
You can't stand in the way of what will be
the greatest revolution in financial services...

205
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,220
in three centuries.

206
00:21:54,220 --> 00:22:05,760
Universal access to basic finance.
Thank you. [Applause]
