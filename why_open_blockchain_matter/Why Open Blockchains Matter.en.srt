1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,940
[Music] Hi!
Wow... Oh my god.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,559
This is quite amazing.

3
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:18,180
I'm really excited to be here at this conference.

4
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:26,520
I'm so excited to be talking to all of you, 
who apparently are developers?

5
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,820
That's what it says back there on the screen.

6
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,490
I assume it's true.

7
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:34,330
How many people in this room have
used open-source software?

8
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,920
[Audience raises hands] Trick question!

9
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,440
I'm just trying to get you to warm up with
some morning exercise.

10
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,850
Everybody raises their hand.

11
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:42,850
Okay, great.

12
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:44,550
Let me ask you a simpler question.

13
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:50,160
How many of you use open-source software
because 'it doesn't cost anything'?

14
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,220
How many of you use it because it gives you freedom?

15
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:58,640
Okay, now we're getting at it.

16
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:02,079
Many of you probably work
with open-source software.

17
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:07,950
Many of you probably work with collaborative
programming and open systems.

18
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:11,890
You work on open applications,
programming interfaces.

19
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:13,800
You work with open libraries.

20
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:21,440
You work with patent-free software and technologies,
with open protocols and open interfaces.

21
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:28,099
None of that is because of how much it costs.

22
00:01:28,099 --> 00:01:30,610
It's because it gives you freedom.

23
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:38,310
I think that's one of the main things that
people outside our industry do not understand.

24
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:47,020
But if you're as old as me, you probably remember
that it wasn't always like that.

25
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:53,800
Throughout the '80s and '90s, there was a
big battle over the future of software; whether

26
00:01:53,800 --> 00:02:01,300
proprietary software would dominate, whether
open software would be available to everyone

27
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:05,500
and used by everyone.

28
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:14,810
I remember a time when I had to persuade 
companies that an open-source version...

29
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:21,620
the Unix operating system was not only
as good, but probably better,

30
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,220
than the closed-source Sun Microsystems
operating system that they used.

31
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:30,590
I had to persuade them that they could use
these systems to replace their proprietary

32
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:39,620
servers, file servers, network
servers, firewalls, routers, etc.

33
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:51,260
There was a time when Bill Gates from Microsoft
said that the internet would be one component

34
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:54,640
of the information super-highway.

35
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,180
Just one component.

36
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:03,840
Because what was more interesting, was how
data would be used in proprietary fashion

37
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,070
and propagated over proprietary protocols
and closed systems.

38
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:17,360
The idea was that corporations wouldn't open
to the internet, because it was "too messy,"

39
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,540
"too weird," and had too much porn.

40
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:29,170
Instead, corporate systems would be perfect
closed gardens.

41
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:37,010
Secure with quality, curated content that
was protected from the wide world.

42
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:44,560
If you worked in a company that actually tried
to put that into practice, you discovered

43
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:57,740
that those systems ended up being insecure,
virus-infested wastelands of stale, useless content.

44
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:03,520
Eventually, most of the people who worked
in these companies had a second phone

45
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:07,650
(maybe a smartphone) so they could
look up things on the internet.

46
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,730
The internet won.

47
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:16,430
The open, uncontrolled, unrestrained internet
won.

48
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:20,479
But it wasn't obvious that it was going to
win.

49
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:24,120
TCP/IP won.

50
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:30,650
There was a time when people said ridiculous
things like "I'm not so interested in the Web."

51
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:35,100
"I'm interested in the technology
behind the Web: HTML."

52
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:45,780
[Laughter] To misunderstand the power and
purpose of a system like the Web so much,

53
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:52,741
as to think that the value of that comes from
a representational format for data,

54
00:04:52,741 --> 00:04:55,350
and the ability to link it to other data.

55
00:04:55,350 --> 00:05:04,280
And miss the point that the really interesting thing is
the ability of anyone, anywhere, to become a publisher.

56
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,240
The democratisation of publishing.

57
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:14,320
The open access to all of the information
in the world, where if it is closed then it is irrelevant.

58
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:21,890
If it is not accessible, it is irrelevant.

59
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:26,410
Today, people say, "I'm not interested in
Bitcoin.

60
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:32,840
I'm interested in the technology behind Bitcoin:
the blockchain."

61
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:37,980
Two days ago when this conference opened, people
were asked 'what is the thing you're most interested in?'

62
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:43,750
"Blockchain" was right in the middle
of the screen, the biggest word there.

63
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,110
Blockchain.

64
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:49,340
The blockchain is a data structure.

65
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:55,800
It's not even a particularly interesting data structure.
It is a hashed linked list.

66
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:59,060
From a technical perspective, it's kind of
boring.

67
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:04,800
What's really interesting about the blockchain
is how the blockchain is created.

68
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,300
What is the process for recording data in
a blockchain?

69
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:20,260
Bitcoin introduced a mechanism to do that
which is open, decentralised, neutral, borderless,

70
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:32,220
and censorship resistant -- kind of like the Web.

71
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:38,100
That's really the interesting thing about
the open Web: that it is open,

72
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:43,281
that no one really controls all of it, and even 
when some companies control big parts of it,

73
00:06:43,281 --> 00:06:49,120
there are still parts that are free,
weird, encrypted, underground.

74
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,660
Still open to creating incredible
new inventions like Bitcoin.

75
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:59,460
It popped out of the internet and no one expected it.

76
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,860
Neutral.

77
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:10,090
For the most part, content is routed across
the Web without regard to the content itself,

78
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:13,980
or really to the source and destination.

79
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:16,210
Censorship-resistant.

80
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:25,040
You cannot erase the Web, you cannot 
(easily) remove information from the Web.

81
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:32,449
Bitcoin introduced a way to apply this to
trusted information, specifically the most

82
00:07:32,449 --> 00:07:37,310
important and trusted information,
which is the ownership of currency.

83
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,900
Money.

84
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:47,370
It created a way to have a recording of ownership
in the blockchain without allowing anyone

85
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:56,560
to have control over who can own money, how
they can spend it, or who can record on this blockchain.

86
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:05,690
Bitcoin made money open, neutral, borderless,
censorship-resistant, and decentralised.

87
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:10,400
The artefact of that technology,
the deliverable, the product,

88
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:15,280
the thing that gets recorded on
your software node, is the blockchain.

89
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:23,580
That blockchain is a necessary but not
sufficient component to create the real magic,

90
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:33,479
which is a platform for trust that is not controlled
by anyone, that cannot be erased or changed

91
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,280
after it has been recorded.

92
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:42,890
A system that is open, neutral, borderless,
and censorship-resistant.

93
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:45,259
It's not about the blockchain.

94
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:54,520
In fact, if you take the blockchain technology,
and you apply it in an environment that is closed,

95
00:08:54,520 --> 00:09:06,080
controlled by one party that can decide which transactions get recorded and which ones do not...

96
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:17,380
[There are] "good" transactions and "bad" transactions,
"evil" transactions, ones that should be censored.

97
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:23,700
Then you lose all of the interesting properties
of the open blockchain.

98
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:29,820
Whenever I talk about this space, I always
put at least one word before "blockchain,"

99
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:33,730
and that is 'open.'

100
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:45,279
'Open' means open-source, open-access, open
to innovation without permission.

101
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:49,290
It means innovation at the edge, not the center.

102
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:52,269
It means no one is in control.

103
00:09:52,269 --> 00:09:55,470
It means there is no censorship.

104
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,019
It means it is neutral.

105
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:03,290
You don't require any patent to participate
in this technology.

106
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:14,110
It is neutral because in this system of trust,
the source, destination, content,

107
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:18,029
and even purpose of your transaction does not matter.

108
00:10:18,029 --> 00:10:26,589
It will be routed and there is no way to stop
someone from routing.

109
00:10:26,589 --> 00:10:33,850
Almost every day, I meet people who come to
me and say, "I'm kind of interested in Bitcoin,

110
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:40,679
but I'm more interested in all the other applications
we can do with the blockchain."

111
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:42,610
Not even "the blockchain," just "blockchain."

112
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:48,230
It's become a generic, abstract word.

113
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:52,579
In most cases, that word is meaningless.

114
00:10:52,579 --> 00:10:59,029
What it means to them is "I'm trying to do
everything where I previously used a database,

115
00:10:59,029 --> 00:11:06,980
only now we can do it with something that is a
hundred-thousand times slower and less well-tested."

116
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:14,480
If you create a centralised blockchain, if
you have a central point of control;

117
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:21,280
if it's not open, borderless, censorship-resistant,
and neutral, then you should have used

118
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:27,519
Microsoft SQL Server Enterprise Edition or Oracle.

119
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:37,900
The problem is, no one is going to pay a consultant
to re-build Dubai's real-estate records on Microsoft SQL.

120
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:41,999
That's not going to get you any magic venture
capital money sprinkled over you.

121
00:11:41,999 --> 00:11:48,500
[That only happens] when you go to Silicon Valley,
go in front of the bathroom mirror in your hotel room,

122
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:53,020
turn off the light and say "blockchain,
blockchain, blockchain" three times.

123
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:57,960
A venture capitalist [will] jump out of the
bathtub and start throwing money at you!

124
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:03,760
[Laughter]

125
00:12:03,769 --> 00:12:08,769
I did a talk which was censored on Facebook
the first day it was published.

126
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:14,499
It was called "Blockchain versus Bullshit."

127
00:12:14,499 --> 00:12:19,560
Apparently that word "bullshit" is not good
for Facebook and censorship is something they do,

128
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:26,079
which kind of proves the point [about
centralised blockchains] really.

129
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:31,540
It's about decentralisation, censorship
resistance, open-access.

130
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:38,949
It's about the ability to use a 'bad' word
to make an important point, to use the shock value

131
00:12:38,949 --> 00:12:45,040
to get people's attention and [hope they] 
listen to the rest of the message.

132
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:50,870
But that's okay, because I don't use Facebook anyway!

133
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:58,329
The bottom line is that this technology is
interesting because, for the first time in

134
00:12:58,329 --> 00:13:06,720
history, it takes one of humanity's oldest
technology (money) and one of the most important

135
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:16,670
aspects of human behaviour (trust), and embeds
these in an open, inter-operable network protocol

136
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,369
without central control.

137
00:13:18,369 --> 00:13:20,509
This has never happened before.

138
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:27,100
Yes, you could imagine a myriad of applications
where the ability to trust in the network protocol

139
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:35,420
and not have to trust in the other party 
you're interacting with, without a third-party

140
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:39,430
that acts as an intermediary.

141
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:44,449
You can imagine many different applications.

142
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:51,090
The problem is that a lot of those applications
really depend on first establishing...

143
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:58,200
the first fundamental application:
value as a content type.

144
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:04,470
When you turn money into a content type, make
it something that is routable across the internet

145
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:14,840
from any point to any other point, without reference
to any third party, self-verifiable, self-authorising,

146
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:19,499
Independently routable money as a network protocol.

147
00:14:19,499 --> 00:14:23,620
That creates the basis for all of the other
applications.

148
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:28,500
That creates the basis for applications of
security and trust that we need to build as

149
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:32,079
an infrastructure to start everything else.

150
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:39,619
If the blockchain is open, decentralised,
neutral, and censorship-resistant,

151
00:14:39,619 --> 00:14:43,639
then it can be used for so many
other interesting applications.

152
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:48,189
But most of the companies you work for 
will not use it that way.

153
00:14:48,189 --> 00:14:55,079
They see the internet of money
and they want to build an intranet.

154
00:14:55,079 --> 00:15:01,509
The natural motivation of a corporation is control.

155
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:05,959
The natural motivation of a government is control.

156
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:12,860
They see this open system and they say, 
"We kind of like it. Immutability, recordability...

157
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:19,000
Auditability, forensic analysis, cryptography...
all of these cute things.

158
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:25,360
Can we have them without the open, borderless,
neutral, censorship-resistant aspects of it?

159
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:35,220
We would like to make it closed, controlled,
censurable, and profitable (for us)."

160
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:42,309
They will build great intranets of money 
and they will be stale wastelands just like the

161
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:53,369
Microsoft FrontPage / Outlook shit you have
in the back office of your corporation.

162
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:59,790
[Applause]

163
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:05,180
When somebody says, "I'm going to apply 
the blockchain to my new application,"

164
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:12,620
the first question you should ask is,
"What kind of blockchain? Why do you need one?"

165
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:17,260
I only have one slide, but if I wanted to do
a perfect presentation about blockchains

166
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:23,760
to a corporate environment, as one of my friends
on Twitter recently said: "You only need one slide...

167
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:28,720
It says 'you don't need a blockchain.'
Thank you! Questions?" [Laughter]

168
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:36,139
The bottom line is that the number of applications
where you truly need a borderless, global,

169
00:16:36,139 --> 00:16:40,540
censorship-resistant, neutral platform to
establish a level of trust and immutability

170
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:48,419
that cannot be attacked or compromised 
by anyone -- even colluding state-level actors

171
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:55,260
and giant multi-national corporations... 
despotic, disgusting, dictatorial regimes

172
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,660
and other censorship ridden hell holes...

173
00:16:57,669 --> 00:17:05,610
The only applications you need that for
can be counted on the fingers of one hand.

174
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:13,960
But I'll tell you which application 
immediately is important: money.

175
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:21,440
We don't like to think that money is an important
application, especially in western liberal culture.

176
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:25,780
Here, money is dirty and "the root of all evil."

177
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:30,730
It's not the money that's dirty,
it's the current architecture of money.

178
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:33,200
Centralised, hierarchical, controlled.

179
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,440
That is dirty.

180
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,360
[We have turned] money into a network protocol
that we can spread to the entire world.

181
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:47,270
[We can] give it to every person who currently
doesn't have access to banking facilities,

182
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:56,440
to billions of people who are cut off from the financial
system just to give us a bourgeois sense of safety

183
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,820
-- which is a lie.

184
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:05,000
[The financial system] is a system of control
so pervasive that it has been weaponised throughout

185
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:11,100
the West, to be used as a system
of political power and control.

186
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:16,760
Proprietary money is the cancer of modern societies.

187
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:21,860
It has infected democracy.
It is killing democracy.

188
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:31,180
The answer to that is open, neutral, borderless,
censorship-resistant, open-source money

189
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:35,380
as a network protocol.
As an open interface.

190
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:42,480
As a system that can be [used by] anyone who
has an IP connected device of the most basic

191
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:50,160
functionality, which gives them the power
to independently verify, authorise, authenticate,

192
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,340
transact globally with anyone.

193
00:18:54,350 --> 00:19:06,110
Once we have that solid platform, we can build
applications of trust like authenticated voting,

194
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:11,860
ownership of real-estate, and other assets.

195
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:19,630
Applications like open-source law through
smart contracts.

196
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:29,790
Realise that cryptocurrencies today are the
largest open, public, consumer / civilian deployment

197
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:34,770
of public key cryptography that
has ever happened (besides SSL).

198
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:39,110
We have now arrived at the golden age of cryptography.

199
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:43,030
The cypherpunks are finally winning.

200
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:50,150
We can apply that amazing technology to one of
humanity's most ancient and fundamental technologies:

201
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:56,410
a system for the communication of value, 
that we call money.

202
00:19:56,410 --> 00:20:02,760
For the first time in history,
money is a content-type, a protocol.

203
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:08,060
Thank you. [Applause]
