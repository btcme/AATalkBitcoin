1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
[ORGANISER] We will kick off [the event]
with a keynote on the future of money.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:08,280
[Here] it really is about looking forward; 
we had a stargazing session this morning.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,860
[This speaker] is someone who doesn't need
a lot of introduction, other than to say...

4
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:16,980
that he is a world-class expert in his field, and has
come all the way to South Africa to talk to us.

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:22,680
Andreas Antonopoulos, welcome to South Africa
and welcome to the conference! [Applause]

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:30,680
[ANDREAS] Hi! Good morning, everyone.
I am so excited to be here.

7
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,040
This conference was called the
'Bitcoin Conference' a couple years ago;

8
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,280
now it is the 'Blockchain Conference.'

9
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,320
Next year, it will be "DLT Technology,"

10
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:49,840
and then the "Database Inspired By, But No Longer In
Any Way Related To, Blockchain" conference. [Laughter]

11
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,580
It is an interesting progression.
Let me do a quick poll of the audience.

12
00:00:53,580 --> 00:01:05,620
I want [to see] your level of experience and familiarity
with this space, back to the yesteryears of Bitcoin.

13
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:11,640
How many of you currently own bitcoin? Fantastic.

14
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:20,680
For those who don't own bitcoin, how many of you have
ever conducted or seen a transaction happen in bitcoin?

15
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:29,280
Great. How many of you do not own any 
cryptocurrency, of any type? Okay, great.

16
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:45,780
How many people are involved with Ethereum
and / or own ether? Great. Dash? Monero? Zcash?

17
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,320
Some interesting [answers].

18
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:56,580
How many of you own "blockchain"? [Laughter]
How many of you have used "blockchain"?

19
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:00,520
Other than in the five [coins] I mentioned previously.

20
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:05,520
All right, okay. A breakdown [of the answers] for those
of you who can't see what the audience is doing:

21
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:13,660
About 60 - 70% have bitcoin at the moment,
or have conducted a transaction.

22
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:19,280
About 30 - 40% [have ether], [with] smaller 
minorities in Dash, Monero, and Zcash.

23
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:28,260
Nobody owns "blockchain."
This is interesting, this is exciting.

24
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:34,960
So, let's get started. What exactly is going on here?

25
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:48,880
Is this the greatest explosion of innovation since
the mobile internet, maybe even the internet itself,

26
00:02:48,880 --> 00:03:02,280
or is this the greatest load of hype ever
arranged in the history of technology?

27
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:09,180
Both. [Hype] is a characteristic of 
[emerging] advanced technologies.

28
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:16,740
I often say that where Bitcoin and other open
blockchains are today, is approximately where...

29
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:19,200
the internet was in 1992 --

30
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:25,540
in terms of [development stages], infrastructure
deployment, and adoption patterns.

31
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,800
This technology is approximately
where the internet was in 1992.

32
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:39,160
The hype around "blockchain" is where
the hype around the internet was in 1998.

33
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:46,280
You know what comes next.
There will be a shake-out.

34
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:53,300
When the waters recede, you can tell who on
the beach wasn't wearing a swimsuit. [Laughter]

35
00:03:53,300 --> 00:04:02,940
They [will] stand there, naked as an empty promise. 
This will happen in the blockchain space.

36
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:16,440
There is a lot of bullshit being peddled to venture
capitalists, to [educated and] uneducated investors.

37
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:22,660
There are a lot of Ponzi schemes,
pyramid schemes, empty promises,

38
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:33,900
and business-as-usual disguised as 
innovation, as disruptive technology.

39
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,500
We are at this strange moment.

40
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:46,000
The underlying technology truly is 
massively disruptive and innovative.

41
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,920
The amount of research happening today
in applied cryptography is unprecedented.

42
00:04:52,920 --> 00:05:00,800
We are looking at [one of] the largest civilian
deployments of public key cryptography [besides SSL].

43
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:06,840
It turns out that people only protect keys 
when those keys are attached to value.

44
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:15,280
Nothing teaches someone about security faster
than having their bitcoin on a Windows machine.

45
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:25,399
[Laughter] Holding your own bitcoin quickly 
changes your attitude towards information security.

46
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:32,040
You didn't care about your photos; some of 
you didn't even care about your sexy photos!

47
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:38,039
You didn't care about your location,
the fact that everything you do was tracked.

48
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,540
You didn't care about posting
your entire life on Facebook.

49
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:47,460
You use the same password ('password1234')
on seventeen different sites.

50
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:52,540
You didn't know what two-factor authentication was.
Then, Bitcoin happened.

51
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:57,000
Suddenly you're on a steep learning curve
and [becoming] better every day.

52
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,940
Now you tell your friends about
two-factor authentication.

53
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:05,660
You are horrified to remember
how you used to practice security.

54
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:13,480
Storing value has this unique ability to focus
your mind on the aspects of security that matter.

55
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:18,540
This technology is driving a
groundswell of security awareness.

56
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:24,860
It is driving the most incredible research
in applied cryptography we've ever seen.

57
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:32,780
Some of you are probably quite technical, involved
in computer science; you see what is happening here.

58
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:41,600
Nobody thought that we would be applying 
Schnorr signatures or elliptic curve [in this way].

59
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:51,280
Nobody thought we would be applying ring signatures
and range proofs for confidential transactions.

60
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,980
The state of anonymity and
privacy is advancing rapidly.

61
00:06:55,980 --> 00:07:02,300
We are building a whole new world
in terms of applied cryptography,

62
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:08,220
on [one of] the largest cryptographically-
secured networks the world has ever seen.

63
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:14,340
That is not business-as-usual. It is highly disruptive.

64
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:23,340
Out of [these developments] came this fantastic saying,
"Blockchain is the technology behind Bitcoin,"

65
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,240
which is incorrect.

66
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:32,780
The blockchain is one of the foundational technologies
behind Bitcoin, and it can't stand alone.

67
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:36,680
But that hasn't stopped people from
trying to sell "blockchain" [on its own].

68
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:42,880
"Blockchain" is Bitcoin with a haircut and
suit that you parade in front of your board.

69
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:51,960
It is the delivery of a sanitized, clean, comfortable
version of Bitcoin, to people who are too terrified...

70
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:56,460
[to] actually [build] disruptive technology.

71
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:05,160
This is a very strange world, where
the words no longer mean anything.

72
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:13,080
Can you define "blockchain" for me? I think a few people
in this room could probably define "blockchain."

73
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:19,440
The real challenge would be defining "blockchain"
in such a way that I can't do search-and-replace...

74
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,740
with the word "database," and
[those sentences still make sense].

75
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:34,280
If what you are [building] is a database with 
signatures, it is not interesting. It is boring.

76
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:40,060
What is the essence of Bitcoin? It is not the blockchain.

77
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:50,440
The essence of Bitcoin is the ability to operate in a
decentralized way, without [needing] to trust anyone.

78
00:08:50,440 --> 00:09:03,400
The essence of Bitcoin is independently verifying
everything yourself, without appeal to authority.

79
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:10,620
You don't trust the other nodes and miners you are
[connected] to. You assume [they may be] lying.

80
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:14,360
You don't trust people creating transactions.

81
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:21,740
You don't trust anything other than the outcome
of your own verification and validation.

82
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:28,640
You end up trusting something
more important: the network effect.

83
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:36,220
Bitcoin introduced decentralized security through
computation, and this has not yet sunk in.

84
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:46,080
Bitcoin allows you to replace a security model based
around concentric circles of access and control...

85
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:54,260
a [centralized] institution, with a security model
that is inside-out, open, and accessible to everyone.

86
00:09:54,260 --> 00:10:04,440
The first security model based on market 
forces and game theory, where [financial]...

87
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:14,760
incentives and punishments ensure that
you can trust the platform as a neutral arbiter,

88
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,400
which is not controlled by any one [entity].

89
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:25,240
[The Bitcoin network is] without third parties,
without intermediaries. Bitcoin revolutionizes trust.

90
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:32,200
It is difficult to have that conversation if you
only focus on Bitcoin. [Many] people have said,

91
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:36,580
"It is not just about currency.
What about the other applications?"

92
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:41,580
"It is not just about Bitcoin.
What about the other blockchains?"

93
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:50,300
In that sense, the term "blockchain" means
something, but only if you define it narrowly.

94
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:55,860
I use the qualifier "open" to talk
about blockchains [that matter].

95
00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:03,780
I'm interested in the applications that 
enable a decentralized, trustless system...

96
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:11,580
which does not rely on anyone as a 
[trusted] intermediary. That is disruption.

97
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:21,140
That is the essence of this technology. 
That essence is seen in other systems.

98
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:25,160
Ethereum exhibits it for smart contract applications.

99
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:32,800
Those smart contracts only work if you don't
[need] to trust anyone to execute it correctly.

100
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:40,160
You can only trust that will happen if everyone can
participate and verify each other in an open manner,

101
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:47,620
if access to the underlying consensus 
algorithm and mining is open to everyone.

102
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:55,040
These characteristics [utilize] the [real] 
power of these blockchain [systems].

103
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:05,060
Open. That is the key word. 
Borderless. There are no borders.

104
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:15,260
Transnational. This is no longer about nation-states,
this is about network-centric trust without third parties.

105
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:20,180
The network is the trusted party,
but only if you verify everything.

106
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:32,960
Neutral. It isn't serving the goals of any one organization
or institution. Everyone follows the consensus rules.

107
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:43,240
There is no such thing as a 'good,'
'bad,' 'valuable,' or 'spam' transaction.

108
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:51,180
[There is no such thing as a 'legal' or 'illegal' transaction.

109
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:57,760
In these systems, there is only a 'valid' or 'invalid'
transaction, based on the consensus rules.

110
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:07,280
It doesn't matter who the sender is, who the recipient is,
what [scripts] or smart contracts are being executed.

111
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:13,360
Neutrality, radical neutrality.

112
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:26,240
Censorship resistance. To ensure that the system
is open, borderless, transnational, and neutral,

113
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:35,620
it must defend these properties by making it impossible
for any actor, or even several colluding actors,

114
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:48,860
to censor or blacklist users, restrict countries,
seize [bitcoin], or freeze transactions.

115
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,680
[All should be able to] participate in this network.

116
00:13:51,680 --> 00:14:01,380
Those are important characteristics of 
these open, decentralized systems of trust...

117
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:07,940
that do not depend on institutions.

118
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:14,780
I would like to equip you with a set of criteria
to understand when you are being presented...

119
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:21,940
with something -- perhaps to invest, [as part of your
employment], or to engage with in some other way --

120
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:29,840
[being called] a "blockchain" or "distributed ledger."

121
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:38,720
How can you tell? Blockchain or bullshit? 
They both start with a 'b-,' but what's the difference?

122
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:45,380
If you can replace the word "blockchain" with
"database," and the brochure reads the same,

123
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,500
it's business-as-usual.

124
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:54,420
It [is probably] not decentralized, borderless,
neutral, censorship resistant, or open.

125
00:14:54,420 --> 00:15:03,180
It [probably] re-establishes trust and intermediaries.
It is just a database. That is not disruptive.

126
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:14,640
The idea that we would use this technology to improve
operating margins of centralized institutions of trust,

127
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:19,200
so that they can continue business-as-usual...

128
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:30,590
I would say it is abhorrent, but that is a strong word. 
It is just boring -- really, really boring.

129
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:35,640
No one [is interested in this technology 
because they want] to make billions...

130
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:45,940
for a financial services clearinghouse; 
if you did, I'm sorry, but that's boring. [Laughter]

131
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:54,860
What is exciting, is the possibility of fundamentally
changing the way we allocate trust on this planet,

132
00:15:54,860 --> 00:16:05,580
opening up the ability to collaborate, transact,
and engage on a global level with everyone.

133
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:13,040
Simply by downloading an application,
you can become part of a giant platform...

134
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,860
that doesn't care who you are or where you came from.

135
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:21,560
It doesn't require permission to participate or innovate.

136
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:30,260
A twelve-year-old JavaScript programmer [could have]
the same influence and power as JPMorgan Chase.

137
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:34,120
[They will have] more [influence], in fact, because
they [are working on] open source [projects]...

138
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:44,420
feeding a community of collaboration that 
is [generating] a tsunami of innovation.

139
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:53,080
[If you try to] take this technology and use it to
strengthen the same centralized institutions,

140
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:59,360
to improve their bottom line, [that] is boring.

141
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:06,360
That is not what a blockchain [is designed for],
that is just a database. It doesn't change anything.

142
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:15,260
There are some rather disturbing possibilities
in this model. Let's think about it for a second.

143
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:23,080
The application most commonly expressed 
for these "distributed ledger technologies"...

144
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:31,480
is to replace the function of a centralized clearing
house with a consortium of 'n' participants,

145
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:40,520
where 'n' is two, three, four, ten etc.
known, permissioned participants.

146
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:47,180
They will [be allowed to] assemble transactions and
sign them, rather than compete [within the market]...

147
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:50,180
of a security model like Bitcoin.

148
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:56,309
[They will] discard currency as the underlying
mechanism for building market-based security.

149
00:17:56,309 --> 00:18:02,929
[They will] discard proof-of-work as "wasteful,"
[even though that enables] a decentralized,

150
00:18:02,929 --> 00:18:06,820
secure, neutral, and censorship-resistant blockchain.

151
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:14,900
We [will need to] trust five named
parties [to authorize] transactions.

152
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:22,640
[But if] they don't need to assemble these transactions
in blocks, because they sign individual transactions,

153
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,240
they don't need to chain them together.

154
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:33,300
Absent proof-of-work and a [reward] incentive,
rewriting [the chain] is easy. There is no immutability.

155
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:39,780
It is not a blockchain anymore.
There are no blocks and no chain.

156
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:46,560
[That was a] technical level [critique],
but let's look at the [political] level:

157
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:53,120
what do you achieve by replacing
a clearing house with a consortium?

158
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,660
[Supposedly], there is something
unique that a clearing house does.

159
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:03,480
If you understand the role of a clearing 
house, one of its important functions...

160
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:11,100
is that it does not participate in the market;
it has no skin in the game.

161
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:21,820
The New York Stock Exchange is not an active trader.
That is not an accident, it is separation of concerns.

162
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:29,580
The clearing house is an independent party
with oversight that is not a market participant.

163
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:38,340
If you take that party out and replace it
with five banks that have skin in the game...

164
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:47,140
How do you run a consensus algorithm when there are
incentives to cheat, front-run, manipulate the market,

165
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:54,400
and break the consensus rules adversarially
against the other four parties?

166
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,040
There's no incentive to keep the consensus rules.

167
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:07,860
All you [can do] is say: "Trust us, we are in a
consortium." Trust you? Trust these five banks?

168
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:17,120
Where were you in 2008? Where were you when
Lieber was fixed, when gold markets were fixed?

169
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:25,900
Where were you when front-running and high-frequency
trading was creating monsters of crony capitalism?

170
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:29,320
"Trust us"? Hell no!

171
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:37,700
Replacing the clearing house with-
What is the word? It is not "consortium."

172
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,560
"Cartel,"" that's the word! [Laughter]

173
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:47,660
Replacing it with a cartel of the same market makers
who manipulated and compromised every market...

174
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:53,320
in history, in a way that [prevents] transparency...

175
00:20:53,320 --> 00:21:05,840
That is not a recipe for efficiency, immutability, security,
or transparency. That is not a blockchain. It is bullshit!

176
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:19,780
It [may be] a very profitable bullshit, [but] it 
requires you to have confidence in a con game.

177
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:27,280
Be careful [how] you evaluate these 
technologies [when you see people]...

178
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:32,500
taking something with the fundamental 
purpose of removing trusted intermediaries,

179
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,600
of creating an open, borderless, neutral system,

180
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:43,320
[while] turning it into a tool for untrustworthy
trusted parties, to manipulate markets.

181
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:49,200
It will be a disaster, but they will do it.

182
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:57,780
I [take] some consolation in
[knowing] that their keys will leak.

183
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:10,300
[In that] centralized system, [they must] secure the five
keys; none of them ever managed to do that [for long].

184
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:17,400
All the companies involved in this brave new
business-as-usual space have been hacked,

185
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:22,309
breached, leaked, and whistle-blown a dozen times.

186
00:22:22,309 --> 00:22:27,340
They cannot keep [all of that]
information secure, no one can!

187
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:32,470
The whole point of a decentralized [system] isn't
keeping information secure [in one or a few places];

188
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:37,940
instead, you spread control out so thin
there is no place to attack it [all] directly.

189
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:43,590
That is what makes it secure. What happens when
you concentrate [control] among five participants?

190
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:51,580
I can't wait until Anonymous and WikiLeaks
collaboratively dump [the keys to the ledger]...

191
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:58,520
from the titans of Wall Street.

192
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:06,500
I can't wait, it [will be] so much fun. And it will happen,
because you cannot secure things [for long like that].

193
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:17,280
Does that mean there's nothing there [in blockchains]? 
No. Again, we go back to the other side [of use cases].

194
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:27,960
This is an incredibly promising technology 
based on an architecture of openness.

195
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:35,440
People are examining this market,
grasping and reaching out in darkness.

196
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:43,380
When you have a new disruptive technology, you can't
see the margins. It is like stumbling around a dark room.

197
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:56,140
Somewhere in there is a billion-dollar company,
an opportunity that will change the world,

198
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:59,740
that will have an impact on humanity.

199
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:06,640
Entrepreneurs look at people's problems
and see them as opportunities.

200
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:12,080
In 1997, when journalists were writing about
'the imminent failure of the internet'

201
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:19,340
and 'the impossibility of finding anything,'
Larry Page and Sergey Brin were finding stuff.

202
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:28,940
They built a multi-billion dollar empire on 
solving the unsolvable problem of search.

203
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:34,960
There are seemingly unsolvable problems in
the open, decentralized, public, transparent,

204
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:40,820
neutral, censorship-resistant, global, trustless
network platform that is the blockchain.

205
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:53,700
Other blockchains, like Ethereum, are trying 
to find their niche. Where are those markets?

206
00:24:53,700 --> 00:25:00,720
There are three elements to success in this industry.
The first [factor] is identifying a viable market.

207
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,620
You [must] stumble in the dark and
find something useful [to do or build].

208
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:09,640
Very often, people stumbling in the dark
don't find anything useful [to do or build].

209
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:20,960
In 1998, Petco was building a online 
commerce empire for pet supplies.

210
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,160
It was too early. The market didn't exist.

211
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:32,090
The web grocer, Webvan, was delivering groceries
to homes in San Francisco and failed miserably.

212
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:38,960
Was that the right market? 
Maybe, but it was the wrong time.

213
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,240
That is the second important [factor]: timing.

214
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:50,160
You can identify [a niche] that, at some point, will
be enormous, but your [timing is] off by a decade.

215
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:57,460
Then the most important factor: sequencing.
[Establishing] the prerequisites.

216
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:05,180
Why wasn't Facebook [popular] in 1992? 
[There wasn't] enough density of adoption.

217
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:08,180
[There weren't] mobile devices
that [could regularly] connect.

218
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:12,280
[There wasn't] even have home internet
that was permanently on, [like today].

219
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:17,340
[There weren't] dense online social networks so
you could engage with people you knew,

220
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:22,180
because [most of] the people you knew 
barely [used] email or didn't even have email.

221
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:30,660
You can't build a complex system that depends on
[the interaction of many parts in] high density...

222
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:37,940
when you [only have] applications
that are one-to-one with low density.

223
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:42,380
To use an example from science: it [would be like]
trying to fuse hydrogen directly into carbon.

224
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:48,700
You can't do that. Helium, lithium, beryllium 
[are in the way]. You have a long way to go.

225
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,780
[You must] keep smashing things together...

226
00:26:50,780 --> 00:27:00,420
before you get enough density and can start
doing interesting things in organic chemistry.

227
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:11,020
You can't do advanced applications like retail
markets, real-estate and title, or voting [yet].

228
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:22,020
You can't do dense consumer-to-consumer markets or
[mass] point-of-sale retail with these systems yet.

229
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:26,540
You can't do most of the [applications] that 
might [have] very interesting markets yet.

230
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:33,280
You can't do them yet because there are not enough
users or liquidity. There is not enough adoption.

231
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:38,200
The user interfaces are terrible; 
applications are still at their infant stage.

232
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:45,400
That doesn't mean these things can't happen,
it just means they [will] not happen this year.

233
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,000
We [will] see [how] this plays out.

234
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:58,620
In order for people to put the title of their home on this
blockchain, it [must] be able to secure not billions,

235
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:01,360
but trillions of dollars in assets.

236
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:06,600
In order to secure trillions of dollars in assets,
it [must] have liquidity and infrastructure.

237
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,060
It [needs] broad adoption.

238
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:14,120
You [will not] get adoption [of an application] that most
people [may only] do twice in their lifetime, [if at all],

239
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:20,560
when you can't even [convince] them
to use it for day-to-day transactions.

240
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:28,260
We [will not build] digital identities so
that everyone can have a bank account.

241
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:32,300
It takes a long time until you have adequate adoption.

242
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:36,840
For the first fifteen years of the internet,
the [killer] application was email;

243
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:44,700
not until everyone had it, [needed to] have it 
for work, did we see the second layer emerge.

244
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:50,200
That created the [necessary] density of adoption.

245
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,900
Currency is the email of blockchains.

246
00:28:53,900 --> 00:29:01,880
Payments are the [killer application]
that will enable density of adoption.

247
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:09,880
It is very enticing to say,
"This is about more than money!"

248
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:18,780
Absolutely, in the long term, the vision
of this technology is far beyond money.

249
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:22,900
But you can't build [those future blockchain 
applications] unless you first build the money part.

250
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:32,780
That is what creates the security, velocity, liquidity,
and the infrastructure. It funds the entire ecosystem.

251
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:46,060
In the end, when we deliver [these applications] to
people, [the purpose] won't be opening a bank account.

252
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:59,980
This isn't about banking the unbanked,
it is about de-banking all of us. Thank you. [Applause]
