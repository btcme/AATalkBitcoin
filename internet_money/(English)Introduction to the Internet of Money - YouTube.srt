1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:01,570
Good evening, everyone!

2
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:03,179
It's such a pleasure to be here.

3
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:08,230
This is my first time in Sweden and I'm enjoying
every moment of it... except for the weather.

4
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:11,920
[Laughter] But other than that, fantastic!

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:17,760
It's so good to be at a conference about the
internet, because I remember my first internet...

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,910
conference. It was in 1992.

7
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:25,650
There were about one hundred people there;
all of them were either computer scientists

8
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,150
or computer science students.

9
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:33,970
Despite the fact that we were telling them
the entire world was about to change, no one

10
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:41,130
believed us -- at least, no one believed me
because I was 19 years old, awkward and shy.

11
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:43,540
That wasn't working so well.

12
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:47,111
But it taught me one thing: it taught me to
trust my instincts.

13
00:00:47,111 --> 00:00:50,260
Because, in fact, it did change the world.

14
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:53,280
My second book is called 
"The Internet of Money."

15
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,450
The reason for that is because the technology
I'm going to talk about today is about to

16
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:01,250
transform the world in equal measure.

17
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:05,309
It will also transform the internet itself.

18
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:12,229
Bitcoin, an invention created on January 3rd
2009 by an anonymous creator.

19
00:01:12,229 --> 00:01:17,119
Unleashed as an open-source project, built
by a community of volunteers.

20
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,450
Run as a peer-to-peer network.

21
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:26,280
Derided, laughed at, and ignored for the first
five or six years.

22
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,779
But not so much anymore.

23
00:01:28,779 --> 00:01:32,079
People are beginning to pay attention, just
like with the internet.

24
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:35,789
Things that were previously unthinkable are
now thinkable.

25
00:01:35,789 --> 00:01:41,619
People are beginning to notice that this is
something more than what they are told.

26
00:01:41,619 --> 00:01:43,989
And what are they told?

27
00:01:43,989 --> 00:01:49,960
Drug dealers! Pornographers! Criminals!

28
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:54,399
Guess what? That's what they said at the first conference in 1992.

29
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,630
They were wrong then and they are wrong now.

30
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:05,609
Every time you meet someone like a dentist
or a hairdress who uses bitcoin, it undermines

31
00:02:05,609 --> 00:02:07,369
that silly narrative.

32
00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:14,380
Bitcoin is a protocol, and what better stage
to talk about a protocol.

33
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:19,320
The moment you start talking about Bitcoin
and thinking about Bitcoin, it brings up

34
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:26,450
a very difficult question: what is money?

35
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:32,380
Most of us, from all the conversations I've
had with thousands of people around the world,

36
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:36,640
have no idea what money is or how it works.

37
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:42,319
It's one of those technologies that is so
deeply embedded in our culture that it has

38
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,989
become completely invisible to us.

39
00:02:44,989 --> 00:02:49,870
In fact, we don't even need to think about
money unless it stops working.

40
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:55,540
In some countries, they realise that it stops
working and then everybody has interesting

41
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:59,280
things to say about what money is.

42
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:06,360
What is money?
At its very basic level, money isn't value.

43
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:12,700
In fact, you use money to get things of value
(products or services), but there is no value

44
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,739
in the money itself.

45
00:03:15,739 --> 00:03:22,099
Money isn't a construct of authority; we seem
to think that these days, because all of our

46
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:27,220
money comes from certain authoritative sources.

47
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:33,219
Some guy with a crown says "this is your money,"
and it's your money.

48
00:03:33,219 --> 00:03:35,120
That's the authority it comes from.

49
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,609
But what if money could be created without
an authority?

50
00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:42,470
What if money could be created simply through
use?

51
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:47,150
It turns out that what money really is, is
a language.

52
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:52,330
Money is a language that human beings created
to express value to each other.

53
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:56,569
As a language, it's one of the fundamental
constructs of civilisation that allows us

54
00:03:56,569 --> 00:04:00,269
to exceed what's known as the Dunbar number.

55
00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:06,840
The Dunbar number is the maximum number of
individuals who can operate in a tribe on

56
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,010
the basis of kinship, of acquaintance.

57
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:16,769
If you want two tribes to work together, you
need some common bond.

58
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:24,771
These bonds have included culture, language,
religion, and money -- a fundamental construct

59
00:04:24,771 --> 00:04:31,720
that allows us to exceed the scale of a single
tribe and engage in commerce with others on

60
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,479
a greater scale.

61
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:41,990
As our money has evolved in its scale, it
has allowed us to collaborate and engage in

62
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:45,919
commerce on a greater level.

63
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:50,900
Money is also, ironically, a system of control.

64
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:55,930
Controlling money confers great power to those
who control it.

65
00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:02,389
As a result, kings and governments have always
held a very tight control over money, pretty

66
00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:08,710
much like how they used to hold it over religion
for the same reasons.

67
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,430
Now that has changed.

68
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:17,800
On January 3rd 2009, the world changed because
some person(s) created a peer-to-peer protocol.

69
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:23,960
A flat network with no central servers, all
clients, that is able to express money as

70
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,000
a content type.

71
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,740
As internet professionals, you may understand
what I mean when I say "money as a content

72
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:38,550
type," money that is expressed purely as data,
transmitted using any communication medium

73
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:40,830
that can convey information.

74
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:45,720
A bitcoin transaction doesn't need to be transmitted
over the Bitcoin network, although that's

75
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,720
a convenient way to do it.

76
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,210
You could encode it in Skype emojis.

77
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:54,210
You could write it up and put it in a Craigslist
ad.

78
00:05:54,210 --> 00:06:01,330
You could post it on Facebook in the background
of a picture of kittens playing with yarn.

79
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:10,840
Money as pure information on a network that
is simultaneously uncensorable, open to anyone,

80
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,479
neutral, and global.

81
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:20,729
There are no borders on this new technology,
just like there are no borders on the internet.

82
00:06:20,729 --> 00:06:25,540
Everyone can access it because it is not a
product, it is not a company.

83
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:28,669
You do not need to register for an account.

84
00:06:28,669 --> 00:06:31,130
You simply download a client.

85
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:37,430
A Bitcoin client is very much like a web browser,
the user interface that 'speaks' the protocol

86
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,360
to other Bitcoin clients out there.

87
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:46,660
As soon as you download that one application,
you can join a global economy; that global

88
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:55,770
economy is open to anyone of any race, religion,
creed, ethnicity, age, and gender in the world.

89
00:06:55,770 --> 00:07:02,340
For most people, this concept hasn't yet quite
sunk in.

90
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:10,449
The children born today may not know a world
in which banks exist, a world in which paper

91
00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:16,720
money exists, any more than the young people
in our industry today have no idea what the

92
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,560
world used to look like before the internet.

93
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,300
How many of you here remember libraries and
looking up reference cards?

94
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,030
Okay, you're over 40 years old.

95
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:31,200
So am I. Gotcha!

96
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:38,340
The children born today may never drive a
car, never have a world without the internet,

97
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:45,169
never know a world where banks control money
and is issued only by kings or nation states.

98
00:07:45,169 --> 00:07:50,210
Money will be an integral protocol of the
internet as a content type that can be transmitted

99
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:53,270
by anyone, anywhere.

100
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,550
But that's not enough.

101
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:56,080
Let's make it more fun.

102
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,830
Every form of money, until today, has to have
a person behind it.

103
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:07,410
Money can only be owned and managed by people,
or people together forming an assocation - a

104
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:10,020
legal fiction called the corporation.

105
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:18,009
But Bitcoin is a protocol where autonomous
agents can own and manage money themselves.

106
00:08:18,009 --> 00:08:20,010
No people required.

107
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:27,000
Imagine a corporation with no directors, no
shareholders, no employees, running entirely

108
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:35,390
based on scripted machine learning or maybe
just a few simple heuristic rules, that operates

109
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:44,790
autonomously of any human action, managing
budgets in the amounts of billions of dollars.

110
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:48,480
At this point in the audience, we have a split.

111
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,250
Some people are thinking, 'Oh no!

112
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:54,090
That sounds terrible.

113
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:55,700
What if it's a virus?

114
00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:02,510
What if it's intelligent ransomware that self-propagates
and buys Amazon Web Service systems so that

115
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,980
it can grow when it's successful?

116
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:11,700
What if it starts running A/B testing on itself
by hiring programmers to make it better?'

117
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:15,940
Yeah, all of that is going to happen.

118
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:23,250
But what if it's an intelligent charity that
detect the emergence of a natural disaster,

119
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:29,820
that automatically and instantaneously diverts
large funds directly to the people most in

120
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,890
need without human intervention?

121
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:40,070
And, unlike most charities today, 100% of
the funds donated go to those in need.

122
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:42,440
The world is about to change.

123
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,780
Self-driving cars?

124
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:46,560
How about self-owning cars?

125
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,470
Cars that are not owned by a corporation,
but cars that _are_ a corporation.

126
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:58,150
Cars that pay for their electricity or gas,
maintenance and leasing fees by giving rides

127
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:01,650
to human beings who pay them in cryptocurrencies.

128
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:09,030
Imagine software such as intelligent articles
that propagate across the internet as content

129
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:13,220
and expand their reach because people read
them.

130
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:17,540
As a result, they're able to buy more hosting
services so they can further expand their

131
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,080
reach.

132
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,560
This is not the money of your grandparents.

133
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,390
It's not the money of your parents.

134
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:29,870
This is money that is fully programmable,
scriptable, with capabilities that can be

135
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,490
finely tuned.

136
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:36,130
You can specify who can access it and when,
how it can be dispersed.

137
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:41,870
A whole new field has opened up which is now
called "smart contracts."

138
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:49,780
This system allows people to program the behaviour
of entire systems that can also manage money.

139
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:56,600
"Money" is such a narrow word to describe
this, because we use things all the time that

140
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,300
kind of look like money but aren't really
money.

141
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:08,110
What about loyalty points, tokens, subway
cards, airline miles?

142
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:15,640
What about the expression of a Justin Bieber
fan with full access to the catalogue of music,

143
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,980
as a token?

144
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:25,360
What about all of the other brands that can
be turned into tokens and made into a global

145
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:31,040
exchangeable system directly on the internet
through this protocol?

146
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:36,440
On January 3rd 2009, the world changed.

147
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:43,630
Since then, more than a thousand other cryptocurrencies
have been created using the same recipe, almost

148
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:45,670
all of them open-source.

149
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:51,941
They're expanding in all directions, exploring
every possible niche of this ecosystem, every

150
00:11:51,941 --> 00:12:00,130
tiny variation in capabilities and features,
creating new markets, raising funds for thousands

151
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:02,630
of start-ups around the world.

152
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:08,320
Thousands of software engineers and developers
are training to use this technology.

153
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,520
The internet itself is changing very rapidly.

154
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:17,920
Now we have autonomous agents that are using
money on the internet; these are, in many

155
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:24,410
cases, beyond the control of any jurisdiction.

156
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:29,360
What are the large corporations going to do
with this new magical, open, decentralised,

157
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,020
neutral, borderless, censorship-resistant
network?

158
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,210
They're going to say, "Great!

159
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:39,660
We'd like that... but could you take out the
open, decentralised, neutral, borderless,

160
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:43,260
censorship-resistant properties and package
it with a service-level agreement (SLA), a

161
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:47,320
twelve-month license, and control?

162
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,580
Control for us."

163
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:53,890
They will take the internet and they will
make intranets.

164
00:12:53,890 --> 00:13:00,880
They will make closed gardens of boring, stale
content that is fundamentally insecure and

165
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:06,310
sits in the backyard of corporations adding
a tiny bit of value.

166
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:11,580
Outside the participation of the global community,
insulated from the wave of innovation that

167
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,520
is happening all around us.

168
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:18,830
They will create these intranets, they will
claim victory, they will turn around and they

169
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:23,190
will say, "We invented Blockchain."

170
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:26,260
They will be wrong and they will fail.

171
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:32,650
The real principle, the real exciting thing
about this technology, is not the blockchain,

172
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:36,950
which is a database artefact created out of
this protocol.

173
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:46,040
It is the ability to achieve distributed consensus
among parties that don't trust each other,

174
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:54,300
across great distances, without any central
party, authority, or intermediary.

175
00:13:54,300 --> 00:14:01,650
That consensus from the outside looks chaotic,
messy, and weird.

176
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:08,410
Well, everyone in this room already knows
something that is open, flat, weird, and not

177
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:10,860
understood by corporations: the internet.

178
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:14,510
We already did it once, we're going to do
it again.

179
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:20,250
This time, we're going to bring the entire
world with us.

180
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:24,690
In the background of this grand story, there
is another story that's playing out.

181
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:31,230
After 25 years of the internet, it still takes
three to five days to send money from here

182
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:33,940
to a country that's not in Europe.

183
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:37,970
It will still cost you $30-40 to send money.

184
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:42,230
That's only if the country you're sending
it to isn't a poor country, in which case

185
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:45,760
it will cost far more and take far longer.

186
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:53,270
A giant network of centralised, closed, corrupt
systems that are sucking money out of the

187
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:55,410
poorest people on this planet.

188
00:14:55,410 --> 00:15:01,260
In 2017, 2.5 billion people do not have access
to banking.

189
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:05,890
That means they have zero access to banking
and are entirely cash-based.

190
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:11,750
That's only counting heads of household -- not
their spouses, not their children.

191
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,070
Clearly they don't 'matter.'

192
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:18,120
That's according to the International Monetary
Fund and World Bank.

193
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:27,790
Imagine what happens if you bring banking
to an app, to everyone who has a $20 Android

194
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:28,790
smartphone.

195
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:33,620
Three-and-a-half to four billion people are
on the internet today; just over one billion

196
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:39,800
people among them have banking and full access
to financial services.

197
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:45,600
We're going to bring it to the other six billion
fast.

198
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,690
This is going to change the world faster than
the spread of cell phones.

199
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:54,240
Imagine a $20 Android landing in a village
in Kenya.

200
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,910
It's no longer just a communications device,
it's a bank.

201
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:01,610
Not a bank account, but a bank.

202
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:05,680
It can 'wire' and receive funds from anywhere
in the world.

203
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:12,950
It can do lending or receive loans for a mortgage,
to buy seeds for a field, to bring disaster

204
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:13,960
relief.

205
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:18,240
It can internationally connect to every person
on this planet.

206
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,860
We can do this within the next ten years.

207
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:27,960
The world will radically transform when you
bring the capability of broad economic inclusion

208
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,870
to everyone in this world.

209
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:32,570
You would think that banks want to do this?

210
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:36,320
You'd be wrong.

211
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:41,240
It's not really profitable serving people
who have little money, little connectivity,

212
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:45,980
no access to ID, in oppressed countries with
terrible governments.

213
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:52,070
Also, in most of those countries, banks _are_
criminals and criminal organisations.

214
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:56,870
Or really quite indistinguishable from the
local mob.

215
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:59,310
So how do we fix that?

216
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:05,189
Up to now the approach for all of these technologies,
whether it was PayPal or any of the others

217
00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:13,839
we've seen slowly emerge in financial technology,
was to carefully and politely ask for permission.

218
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:18,220
Bitcoin is not asking for permission.

219
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:21,069
We "forgot" to do that.

220
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:27,610
And we will proceed in (un)banking the entire
world without asking for anyone's permission.

221
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:29,990
This protocol is now spreading.

222
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:34,919
If this one gets shut down, a 14-year-old
with a copy of my book can rebuild it in a

223
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:40,330
weekend, in any programming language, and
launch it again with a new name.

224
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:44,399
Again and again until we succeed.

225
00:17:44,399 --> 00:17:46,710
The world is now connected.

226
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:52,429
Finance is now an application and money is
a content type.

227
00:17:52,429 --> 00:18:00,009
Welcome to our new planet.

228
00:18:00,009 --> 00:18:12,509
Thank you.
