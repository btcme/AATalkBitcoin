00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:13,180
[ANDREAS] Hi, everyone! I'm so glad to
be here at LABitConf. This is my fourth.

2
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,740
I think I've only missed one.

3
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:21,240
Huge thanks to Rodolfo Andragnes, who opened
[the event] with such passion and enthusiasm.

4
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:27,300
I understood about half of it, because
he speaks very fast in Spanish.

5
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:36,320
My Spanish is still at the Duolingo 'level two' standard.
I won't be doing my presentation today in Spanish.

6
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:43,680
Maybe in two years. Every now and then
I try to practice a bit with Duolingo.

7
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,160
It pops up little reassuring messages [such as],

8
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:55,940
"More Americans are studying foreign languages
on Duolingo than in public schools in America."

9
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:01,120
Great statistic, right? It would be true
if only two people were using Duolingo;

10
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:07,980
[American schools] don't really teach foreign
languages, but -- you know -- we are trying there.

11
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:15,560
Spanish will be my fourth language. I hope I can get
to the level where I can order food in a restaurant...

12
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,180
without embarrassing myself.

13
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:23,920
That is where [I am] at the moment. Not ready
to [speak about] Bitcoin [in Spanish] quite yet.

14
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,560
[But] I'm really excited to be here.

15
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:41,220
I would like to talk about a topic that keeps coming up
[around] Bitcoin: black markets. [Haunted noise]

16
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:50,320
You see, bitcoin is used for black markets. You have
heard about that, yes? It is used for black markets.

17
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:59,040
Of course, it is also used for some white markets too. 
In Argentina, it is used for some blue markets.

18
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,440
["Blue market"] is what they renamed their black market
because it is such a big part of the economy,

19
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:07,360
and they want it to sound more palatable.

20
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:14,680
Bitcoin is colorblind when it comes to markets.
It doesn't distinguish between black and white markets,

21
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:23,700
blue and gray, or any other colors in the 
rainbow of markets; it just serves markets.

22
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:31,520
The real question is, what is the difference 
between a white market and a black market?

23
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:40,520
Is the color a good metric for us to understand [how
these] markets function? I think it is a very poor metric.

24
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:52,160
Calling a market "white" or "black" doesn't tell us much
about what that market does or how well it works.

25
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,200
The people who use [such] terms would 
really like you to think there are a whole set...

26
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,580
of [moral] associations that go along with that color.

27
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:09,240
'White markets are good, black markets are bad.'
'White markets are legal, black markets are illegal.'

28
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,440
'White markets are [functional],
black markets are [dysfunctional].'

29
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:21,320
'White markets are fair, black markets are unfair.'
'White markets are safe, black markets are unsafe.'

30
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:26,760
'White markets are moral, black markets are immoral.'

31
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:36,380
Bullshit! [Laughter] [Applause]

32
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:40,240
Not a single one of those statements is true.

33
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:46,420
White markets and black markets differ
in only one essential component:

34
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:54,880
white markets are licensed, black
markets are unlicensed. That is it.

35
00:03:54,880 --> 00:04:06,440
Black markets can be moral, safe, just, fair, and efficient;
simultaneously, white markets can be immoral, unsafe,

36
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:10,180
unjust, [unfair], and inefficient.

37
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:20,680
We all know this. [Subconsciously], we know it.
The taxi cartel is a white market; Uber is a black market.

38
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:31,700
I won't take a bloody taxi. I have been to fifty-three
countries and robbed by taxi drivers in fifty-two.

39
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:38,200
"The airport is here. My hotel is here."
"Let's go that way!" [Dramatic, long-route loops]

40
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:45,740
"On triple tariffs with seven extras that I just invented."
This has happened to me in every country in the world.

41
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:56,460
Why? Because it is a regulated, licensed guild. A cartel.
It is an inefficient, broken market, full of corruption.

42
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:04,560
Uber works. It is efficient, fair, and 
transparent, but it is a black market.

43
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:10,640
We don't call it a black market because it is run
by a multinational corporation with nice graphics...

44
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,980
and [a ticker symbol on] the stock market index.

45
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:19,440
We don't really want to call it the black 
market, but it is, if it is not licensed.

46
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,940
Right outside this place, there are cute
little electric scooters with lime colors.

47
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:28,140
Have you tried those? They are so much fun.

48
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:35,800
You can go fifteen miles per hour on the sidewalk or
the street; I'm sure one of the two is illegal, but not sure.

49
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:42,600
You [must] wear a helmet -- I didn't, I'm sorry, that was
probably illegal -- and the service itself is not licensed.

50
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,620
So that is a black market.

51
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:54,280
In North Korea, you can only have one of six haircuts
if you are a male, which means [mine] is a black market.

52
00:05:54,280 --> 00:06:06,560
It is not one of the approved haircuts. [Laughter]
I call it a haircut, but it is just the result of hair loss.

53
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,960
But I would still like to pretend
for a few more years, while I can.

54
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:20,620
There is nothing essentially moral about white markets,
nothing essentially immoral about black markets.

55
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:29,900
General Dynamics selling cluster bombs to the Saudis
is the whitest of white markets; it is not only legal,

56
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:35,220
it is strongly encouraged [by the U.S. government] and
I [am forced to] pay for some of it [as a] taxpayer.

57
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:40,880
Is it moral? Hell no, it isn't.

58
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:48,100
The person selling bananas on the street, without a
merchant's license, is the black market. Is it moral?

59
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,640
Hell yes, it is.

60
00:06:50,640 --> 00:07:02,480
Using bitcoin to escape a collapsing currency in
Venezuela is highly illegal and a [grey] market.

61
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:10,840
Is it moral? It is a human right. It is not just moral,
it is the obligation of a parent to protect their children,

62
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,940
[including] under the U.N. Convention for Human Rights.

63
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:23,380
[Yet] it is illegal, with heavy penalties.
The things Maduro is doing? 'White market' everywhere!

64
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:28,560
Perfectly legal, fully licensed, and completely broken.

65
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,240
The difference between white and
black markets is an issue of licensing.

66
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:39,860
What is the natural state of markets?
The big gray [market] in between.

67
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:44,400
Grey markets don't emerge, they simply exist.

68
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:50,820
In the absence of any other forms, all markets are grey.

69
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:58,060
How do white markets emerge? You have a gray market
in place and someone gives it a license. Now it is white.

70
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:02,700
[How do black markets emerge?] You have a gray market
in place and someone makes it illegal. Now it is black.

71
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:09,860
Markets [exist] anytime two [or more] individuals,
without coercion and of their own free will,

72
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:19,160
decide to transact and agree on a
price they find [mutually] beneficial.

73
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:27,380
That is a market. That is it. It doesn't have a color,
didn't require permission, and doesn't need a license.

74
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:34,140
It is a natural human activity that occurs 
everywhere, in every time, throughout history.

75
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:40,720
But we want to invent new terms in order to 
somehow provide 'color' to these markets;

76
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:45,560
legitimacy to some, illegitimacy to others.

77
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:52,140
What is the trajectory of every white market?
Every white market starts off as a grey market.

78
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,980
Then it gets licensed.

79
00:08:53,980 --> 00:09:01,240
Initially, the licensing is sold to you as a way to enforce
some kind of "good behaviour" standard or quality.

80
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:08,180
After all, you want your doctors to be licensed, [right]?
They always go back to that [example].

81
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:15,000
In some U.S. states, ten thousand or more 
professions require professional licensing.

82
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,760
In Louisiana, the amount of hours you need to become
a cosmetician that does [manicures or pedicures]...

83
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:28,380
exceeds -- by four times -- the hours you need to become
an emergency medical technician in an ambulance.

84
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,740
If you try to do nail [manicures] without a license,

85
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:41,200
you will be arrested because you are operating
in the black- red, teal, and sparkly [markets].

86
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:49,020
Which [color] you choose is up to you, but 
you certainly don't have the requisite license.

87
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:55,540
Gradually, guilds and "professional associations"
form, whose primary purpose is to make sure...

88
00:09:55,540 --> 00:10:05,000
there isn't [too much] competition, to keep out those
who would try to emerge into the market [themselves].

89
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,320
Like the taxi cartel, right?

90
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:13,280
Licenses gradually become guilds, where it is a matter
of whether you can afford to buy [your way] into it.

91
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:21,260
The quality standards, the certification, the regulation,
the rules, all gradually disappear into the background.

92
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:26,660
The regulators stop doing those things and focus
primarily on enforcing [entry into the market].

93
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:31,880
People forget why the rules exist.
It simply becomes a professional guild.

94
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:38,500
If you can afford to buy the necessary licenses,
essentially bribe the government to allow you to work,

95
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:43,840
then you are part of the white market.

96
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:47,300
All white markets devolve into that state.

97
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:55,220
Over years, maybe decades or centuries, you arrive
at absurd concentrations of wealth and power,

98
00:10:55,220 --> 00:11:05,100
where you might have only seven families 
controlling every business in the country.

99
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:10,300
The fundamental differences between 
markets, white or black, should not be...

100
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,700
measured by how well they are licensed.

101
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:17,920
We should care about whether
they are fair, open, and free.

102
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:26,000
In fact, if these markets are open
and free, fairness arises as a result.

103
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,820
If you don't like it, you can trade elsewhere. 
Competition ensures fairness.

104
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:45,620
Here is the other subtle thing: absent a licensed white
market, the state withdraws [any] services of justice.

105
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:48,140
This is critical to understand.

106
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:54,360
Until now, the monopoly on the delivery of justice
services existed primarily in the government's sphere.

107
00:11:54,360 --> 00:12:01,200
Let's use tech terms: goverments
provided 'justice as a service' (JaaS).

108
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:07,320
Their 'justice as a service' API is only available for a
certain fee to certain people, and it is usually broken.

109
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:13,100
It [may] take seven years [or longer] to fulfill the request;
nevertheless they offer 'justice as a service.'

110
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:18,800
But if you step outside of the white market, 
[your access to] 'justice as a service' is removed.

111
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,780
You are exposed to the full risk of operating in a market
where you have no justice [services from them],

112
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:32,160
where you have no recourse [facilities], no ability to
settle disputes, and violence becomes the solution.

113
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,940
That happens even in white markets.
I walked out of the airport here in Chile,

114
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:45,640
straight into a line of taxi drivers, who see me
looking at my phone and say, "Uber?!" [Laughter]

115
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:58,900
[Backs away slowly] "Sorry!" What [should] I do then?
Do I [alert] the police officer [about their behaviour]?

116
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:04,220
No, because in every country I've been to, 
the cops are working with the taxi drivers...

117
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:08,080
to beat up the Uber drivers and their passengers.

118
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,140
Not only have they removed 'justice as a service,'

119
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:16,460
they deliver injustice as a service
[within] a [noncompetitive] blockade.

120
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:25,760
You don't go to the cops, because that is too dangerous.
But I don't get my Uber ride, what is the big deal?

121
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,260
Think about all the markets in which 
'justice as a service' has been removed,

122
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:39,600
where you cannot enforce property rights; where [a
currency exchange desk gives you] counterfeit money.

123
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:47,580
Do you call the police? No, you don't call the police.
You can't call the police. That service [was] removed.

124
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,120
You have some funny situations,

125
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:56,340
like the [inexperienced] high school student trying
to buy marijuana from some dude on the street.

126
00:13:56,340 --> 00:14:02,840
They get a bag of oregano [instead] and 
don't know the difference, so they think,

127
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:12,840
'I don't [know if] I should smoke this. Smells like a salad.
Now what do I do? Do I call the cops? I can't call cops...'

128
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:21,800
"Excuse me, sir. The illegal drugs I just bought
are not correct!" Some people [actually] do that.

129
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:29,460
They go to the police and say, "This cocaine isn't good!"
They soon discover that they [have a bigger] problem.

130
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:33,560
Again, that's a little funny story and
you might think they deserve what they get.

131
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:37,280
After all, they are breaking the law
and so they should be punished.

132
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,800
Now, think about the immigrant cleaner...

133
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:46,160
who had their passport taken from them by
a coyote who [escorted] them across the border,

134
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,740
now holding their passport hostage.

135
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:54,640
They are terrified to go to the police and live in
a locked compound with bars on the windows.

136
00:14:54,640 --> 00:15:03,340
They cannot exercise their human rights, virtually
kept as slaves within an industrialized society.

137
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:08,700
That happens today, in the United States, 
to hundreds of thousands of people.

138
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:13,440
Slavery is on the uptick all around the world. Why?

139
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:21,680
Being an illegal human being -- I don't even 
know what that means -- has resulted in...

140
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:28,080
the removal of 'justice as a service'
from entire categories of people.

141
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:35,020
Apply that to sex workers, engaging
in acts of consensual sex or prostitution,

142
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:39,400
even just people stripping and making funny movies.

143
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,820
They have no 'justice as a service.'

144
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:49,940
Violence, rape, and domestic abuse are 
massive problems in any illegal industry.

145
00:15:49,940 --> 00:16:02,360
Black markets emerge where the need is great,
where the demand causes an emergence of supply,

146
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:11,620
whether that is capital flight from Argentina, recreational
drugs, or whatever else you might want to find.

147
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:15,240
If there is no white market, the black market exists...

148
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:22,020
but it charges a massive risk premium, 
sprinkled with a heavy dose of violence.

149
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:28,780
Until now, justice could only be
provided as a government service.

150
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:36,780
You cannot enforce property rights
without a court of law... or can you?

151
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:44,820
What if we used a very large number,
multiplied against another on an elliptic curve?

152
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,660
[What if, in combination with other factors], 
that crazy idea [of computer science and math]...

153
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:52,140
would allow me to enforce global property rights?

154
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:57,820
What if I could use a smart contract in order to
create a matching service between buyers and sellers,

155
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:01,580
that ensures there is no forgery, no fraud?

156
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:09,060
What if I could use a smart contract to escrow money
in the process of buying any product?

157
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:12,320
Now I can ensure [people] don't get cheated.

158
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:20,320
What if I could use a smart contract [for] reputation
services like Uber does, giving me a degree of comfort...

159
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:23,780
without the centralized company?

160
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:29,940
What if I could get 'justice as a service' from a network?

161
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:37,140
That is what happened. The world has changed.
It is not a distinction between the licensed market,

162
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:42,080
where you have some justice, and the 
unlicensed market, where you have no justice.

163
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:47,440
Bitcoin doesn't care. Ethereum doesn't care.
[Open] blockchains don't see colors.

164
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:53,140
They don't see borders and they don't
see [authorities]. They only see rules.

165
00:17:53,140 --> 00:18:01,140
They can deliver 'justice as a service' no matter
what color your market is: white, black, or grey.

166
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:13,340
Bitcoin, Ethereum, [and other open blockchains]
serve markets wherever there is supply and demand.

167
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:18,020
They serve markets globally, 
without distinction for borders.

168
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:21,800
Here is another little secret you don't remember:

169
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:27,260
state 'justice as a service' only
applies within a specific geography.

170
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:32,220
The Chilean justice provider only
works within the borders of Chile.

171
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:39,620
What can you do with that [limitation] as an individual?
Not much. What can multi-national companies do?

172
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:44,560
They can screw you in a hundred
and ninety-four different countries.

173
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,560
Unless they are in [the same jurisdiction
as you], you don't have much recourse.

174
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:55,160
Then again, they [may have] also bought your legislators,
so you don't have recourse in that one either.

175
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:58,000
Blockchain 'justice as a service' works globally.

176
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,600
It doesn't care whether you are
inside or outside that border.

177
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:11,120
The other little [secret] we often forget: when people
say a product is illegal, your first question should be:

178
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:20,000
"Illegal where?" 'Legal' and 'illegal' are 
geography-bound terms. Illegal where?

179
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:32,500
Illegal here? What if I'm not here, but in another country?
Is it legal there? These are highly relative notions.

180
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:42,800
They imply a strong morality component that
you may not share. Is it legal to buy a Bible?

181
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:54,160
In Saudi Arabia, it's not. In Saudi Arabia, it was also
illegal to drive unless you fulfill both requirements:

182
00:19:54,160 --> 00:20:02,500
a driver's license and a penis. [Laughter] 
Well, until recently. They fixed that one.

183
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,120
Now you can drive without [the second] one.

184
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:14,580
But you might still get beaten up by the cops, because
they are "protecting their morality." Not my morality.

185
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:21,480
Is it legal to buy certain substances?
Is it legal to buy bombs to [attack] another country?

186
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:26,380
Again, legality is bound by geography [and authority].

187
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:32,320
Blockchains are not. With the blockchain, 
you can enforce justice across borders.

188
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:39,020
You can enforce justice across the world,
whether you consider the markets within the narrow...

189
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:45,600
scope of your own country [to be]
white or black, grey or blue.

190
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:56,880
Blockchains serve justice. They can deliver 
free, open, and fair markets worldwide.

191
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:02,700
Does that mean you can use blockchains 
for the black market? Hell yes, it does.

192
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:11,360
There is a demand for that. To make white markets
better? Yes. And every [color] in between? Yes.

193
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:19,060
It is not about white. It is not about black.
It is about free, open, and fair. Thank you!

194
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,960
[Applause]

195
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:30,040
[AUDIENCE] Hello. It is really great to be 
able to see you live, after all these years.

196
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:39,880
My question is, how will you be able to enforce
'justice as a service' from a blockchain?

197
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:53,600
There is a monopoly on force, but there is also a judge,
[who have judicial monopolies] in the state.

198
00:21:53,600 --> 00:22:00,040
[ANDREAS] Again, the word "enforcement" contains
the word "force," but does it have to [in practice]?

199
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:07,920
How much of our current commercial transactions really
require that level of recourse, where you have force?

200
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:16,240
Force can be applied to a certain degree, but once you try to apply it to too many people, too many things,

201
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,040
for too many reasons...

202
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:24,240
You [must] pay people to apply the force, and by that
time you have messed your currency up so well...

203
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,080
that you can't pay the enforcers.

204
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:35,000
In Venezuela, for example. I watched a great video the other day, which showed some enforcers for Maduro...

205
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:42,080
smiling in front of a camera, holding the privileges
of their position, which were two toilet paper rolls.

206
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:47,080
That is how low payment for the 
enforcement service [has become].

207
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:55,360
How far away [are they] from the moment 
when they [decide], 'This is not worth it!'

208
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:01,040
Enforcement and force are aspects
of the human condition and society.

209
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,920
What we are talking about here is enforcing justice...

210
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:09,920
through rules agreed on by everyone in
a consensus system without violence.

211
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:15,920
This is a non-violent mechanism for enforcement.
It is primarily financial enforcement.

212
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:22,000
It works through a series of incentives 
and punishments, game theory.

213
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:29,040
What we found through markets and game theory is
that those [non-violent] mechanisms work better.

214
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:35,000
They don't expect people to be good,
they only expect people to act in their self-interest.

215
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:42,240
If everybody acts in their self-interest in a system
of rules that punish bad and reward good behaviour,

216
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:47,240
then good behaviour emerges
naturally from the system.

217
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:52,160
I don't know how well it [will] work, but 
let's build some things and test them out.

218
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:59,920
I certainly know, one of the beautiful things about
operating on digital platforms, one of the reasons...

219
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:11,520
why people want to run drug markets on the internet,
is because you cannot be stabbed over TCP/IP.

220
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:26,560
[ORGANISER] Next question?
I think there was one in the back.

221
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:32,840
[AUDIENCE] Hi, I want to ask you about 
black markets, white markets, and banks.

222
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:38,000
[ANDREAS] Yes. [AUDIENCE] We have so 
many problems with banks "de-risking."

223
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,640
Let me know what you think about that, 
because it is part of [how they keep control].

224
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,120
[ANDREAS] Well, that is the final 
culmination of a white market.

225
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:52,360
When the rules that start off as "consumer protection"
eventually become "banker protection."

226
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:57,760
As a result, they become protection
from competition, which leads to a guild.

227
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:02,080
Once a guild is powerful and organised enough,
we have a different word for that. It is called a cartel.

228
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:08,560
We don't use the word "cartel" to refer to banks,
because they have such a big cartel. [Laughter]

229
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:16,960
Banks no longer serve many of the important functions
that you would expect the banks to serve.

230
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:26,840
They don't [even] bank people. The number of unbanked
is not decreasing, twenty-five years into the internet.

231
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:34,080
They are not serving [more people]. I was [giving a talk]
at a security conference that was full of bankers.

232
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:41,040
I was describing how bitcoin, as a form of money,
can serve populations that are doing remittances...

233
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:47,000
to foreign countries, but who don't have bank accounts
because they are not properly documented.

234
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,480
They are illegal immigrants or migrants into a country.

235
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:55,960
As a result, they can't open a bank 
account and pay enormous fees...

236
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:03,880
to be robbed by the grey market of Western Union
and [various] check cashing services.

237
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:13,000
During my presentation, this lady in the back asked,
"But why should we give bank accounts to illegals?"

238
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:19,760
At least half of the people in the room 
were decent enough to gasp. [Laughter]

239
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:36,000
But the other half were really interested in the answer,
so I said, "No, you shouldn't. Don't. We will." [Applause]

240
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,520
[ORGANISER] Okay, one more question?
[AUDIENCE] Hi, Andreas. [ANDREAS] Hello.

241
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:46,960
[AUDIENCE] It is a pleasure to meet you, thank you
for being a great teacher and inspiring everyone.

242
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:53,200
My question is about blockchains,
not in general but as an educator myself.

243
00:26:53,200 --> 00:27:00,880
I am trying to battle every start-up that says "blockchain"
without [using] a blockchain or [doing] decentralisation,

244
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,840
disintermediation, just a database.

245
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:11,160
What is [your] recommendation
for us to battle that movement?

246
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:16,200
To call everything "blockchain" while not 
doing anything innovative or decentralised?

247
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:21,040
[ANDREAS] You don't need to "battle" anything.
What you need to do is just remove your attention...

248
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,200
and interest from these projects,
because they serve no purpose.

249
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:29,920
You [must] ask yourself, when you hear 
that someone's project has "blockchain"-

250
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:35,000
Well, nowadays what they usually say is:
"We are introducing a revolutionary new system."

251
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:43,880
"Blockchain, artificial intelligence, and internet-of-things,
using neural networks to [magic noise] give me money."

252
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:58,840
At that point, you [should] stop listening or ask, "Is it borderless, open, neutral, global, censorship resistant?"

253
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:05,720
If it is not, you don't need a blockchain. Those are the
features provided by open, decentralized blockchains.

254
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:13,480
Ask those five questions, ask for the five pillars.
If it is none of those things, then it is just a database.

255
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:19,880
It is a centralized and very inefficient, slow,
expensive database that is difficult to develop...

256
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:24,840
and has a really shitty user interface.

257
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:32,040
In the era of Microsoft databases and Oracle, it takes
a lot of effort to produce an even shittier interface.

258
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:38,640
The bottom line is, this is not a good solution for
anything if you are not looking for those features.

259
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:43,040
Do you need to fight that market [of bullshit
blockchain projects]? No, don't fight it.

260
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:53,400
Let them spend $100 million training developers and
consultants in this industry, while producing bullshit.

261
00:28:53,400 --> 00:29:00,920
Once that project fails, those developers will look
around and [wonder], 'What do we do now?'

262
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:04,040
'I heard about this other project,
I would like to work on that.'

263
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:11,040
And then they go work on a real open-source, 
decentralized blockchain. I [was] saying this in 2013,

264
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:18,280
that [banks] will [pay to] train developers and those
developers will discover Bitcoin and open blockchains.

265
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:24,960
[They will think], 'These are much more interesting
projects.' When I was visiting Singapore, it happened.

266
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:31,640
I sat down next to a kid who said to me, "I'm really
excited, this is my first Bitcoin conference."

267
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,480
"I watched one of your videos."

268
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:40,160
"You know... I have been working with blockchains for a
year, but I had not heard about Bitcoin until yesterday."

269
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:49,080
[Taken aback] [Laughter] I asked, "What? 
How? Tell me more, I want to hear!"

270
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:57,760
[He said], "A year ago, I went to this presentation by Bank
of America about decentralized ledger technology."

271
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:04,000
"Eventually, at some point in the slides, they
mentioned the 'b' word." Not Bitcoin, but "blockchain."

272
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,760
"They told us this would be the greatest technology."

273
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:11,920
"They managed to go through all thirty slides
without mentioning the other 'b' word at all."

274
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:19,560
This person worked with Hyperledger, R3, and
all of these other companies in the "DLT space."

275
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:25,000
And those were... interesting, but not that interesting.
Then one day, they discovered Bitcoin and thought,

276
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:35,080
'Whoa! This is where it came from? This seems
very weird and a bit exciting!' [Laughter]

277
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:38,880
And we gained one more developer, 
perfectly trained and ready to go.

278
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:45,080
They just needed to re-learn some basic concepts,
and they are good to go on a nice open-source project.

279
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,000
Don't fight that market.

280
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:53,720
Let them waste bank money on trying to co-opt
and distort the ideas of what we're building,

281
00:30:53,720 --> 00:31:00,600
then run straight into the wall of their 
centralized, sclerotic, dinosaur organisations.

282
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,960
Then the project fails to deliver anything 
and gets chopped by the board of directors,

283
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,040
who are no longer impressed by the word 'blockchain.'

284
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:13,240
The people [from that project] take their Christmas
bonus [and use it to open] a start-up in January,

285
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:16,000
in order to compete with [their former bank bosses].

286
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:24,720
[The banks] pay for their own demise. [Applause]
[ORGANISER] Thank you so much! Time is up.

287
