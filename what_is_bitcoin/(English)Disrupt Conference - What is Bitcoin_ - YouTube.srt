00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,660
[Music introduction]

2
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:28,840
Καλησπέρα, Αθήνα. Good afternoon, Athens.
Thank you for having me today.

3
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:37,220
You want disrupt? I got disrupt.
No. I have downright revolution.

4
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:45,980
We will talk about the most exciting, interesting,
and probably important technological innovation...

5
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:50,060
and invention in computer science
within the last twenty years.

6
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:55,340
I am here to talk about Bitcoin.
Perhaps you have heard about Bitcoin before.

7
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:01,440
Let's do a quick check. How many of
you have heard of bitcoin before today?

8
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:09,720
All right, we have a good crowd.
How many of you own bitcoin? Even better.

9
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:15,340
Bitcoin is digital money,
but it is so much more than that.

10
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:25,880
Bitcoin is digital money like the internet
is a fancy telephone, or all about email.

11
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,520
Money is just the first application.

12
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:38,220
Bitcoin is a technology, a currency,
and an international payment network.

13
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:48,120
It is decentralized. It doesn't rely on banks or 
governments. We have never done this before...

14
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,360
in the history of humanity.

15
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:58,920
This invention is truly revolutionary. When we look
back, we will see that this was a historic moment...

16
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:05,440
in the evolution of not only computer science,
but a socio-political revolution in the making.

17
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,360
Let's get started. Bitcoin is digital money.

18
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,300
Euros and dollars are also digital, but 
bitcoin is not owned by a government.

19
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:25,520
You can send it from anywhere in the world,
near instantaneously, securely, and for minimal fees.

20
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,460
Two days ago, we saw one of the largest transactions
ever recorded on the Bitcoin network.

21
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:42,280
Someone transferred $150 million [worth 
of bitcoin] in [about ten minutes], for zero fees.

22
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:52,980
That should allow you to grasp how disruptive this
will be, in terms of international payment systems.

23
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:56,120
But this is just the beginning.

24
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:04,420
Bitcoin is a digital currency that was invented
in 2008 by a person called Satoshi Nakamoto.

25
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:11,840
He published a paper where he posited that he
had found a way to create a decentralized network,

26
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:18,960
that could achieve consensus / agreement 
without any central controlling authority.

27
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:25,640
If you study computer science or distributed systems,
this is known as the Byzantine Generals' Problem.

28
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:31,720
It was first described in [1982].
Until 2008, it was an unsolved problem.

29
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:39,360
But we understood the importance of solving it.
Satoshi Nakamoto said that he had solved it.

30
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:45,820
Guess what happened next? Everybody laughed.
Many ignored and dismissed him.

31
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:55,500
He published the whitepaper. Three months later,
he published the software to start the Bitcoin network.

32
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:05,640
Bitcoin is not a company or organization.
It is a standard protocol, just like TCP/IP for the internet.

33
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:10,460
It is not owned by anyone [single entity].
It operates based on mathematical rules.

34
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:14,000
Everyone who participates in
the network must agree on them.

35
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:25,820
Bitcoin is a decentralized network of computers that,
through this consensus mechanism, agree on...

36
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:34,040
what transactions have occurred on the network,
and who currently owns what money.

37
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:44,120
If I send money to somebody else's "account"
in this peer-to-peer network, like sending email,

38
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,480
there is no one in the middle.

39
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:50,800
[The bitcoin transaction is broadcast] from
my computer to the recipient's computer,

40
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,920
without intervention.

41
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:58,220
Every ten minutes, the network agrees
on what transactions have happened,

42
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:04,220
without any centralized authority,
a kind of election that occurs electronically.

43
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:09,280
This particular solution [to the Byzantine Generals'
Problem] is far more important than currency.

44
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:16,480
Currency is just the first application that you
can build on a distributed consensus system.

45
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:27,040
Other applications include voting, stock ownership,
asset registration, notarization, and many others.

46
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:33,820
Applications we have never thought of before.
I discovered Bitcoin for the first time in 2011.

47
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,740
Since [the early days of] the internet,

48
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:42,820
I have not felt this feeling of being completely
overwhelmed by the possibilities I saw.

49
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:47,940
I was there at the dawn of the internet
in 1991, when it was pre-commercial.

50
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:53,840
I could see that this would change the world.
I told everyone around me, but no one believed me.

51
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:59,920
I have that exact same feeling about Bitcoin.
Some of you may have heard of bitcoin as a currency,

52
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:07,820
as a system of money that is currently 
wildly high in price one day and low the next.

53
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:16,140
I am here to tell you to ignore the price, ignore bitcoin
the money, but understand Bitcoin the technology...

54
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:19,260
and the network it creates.

55
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:24,260
If we mess up the money,
we can just reboot another currency.

56
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:34,200
Bitcoin the technology cannot be uninvented.
It creates the possibility for decentralized organization...

57
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:39,720
on a scale never seen before on this planet.

58
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:49,880
Here is why it's important to me: today in the world,
approximately one billion people have banking,

59
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:57,920
access to credit and international finance capabilities,
primarily among the upper classes and western nations.

60
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:04,180
Six and a half billion people on this planet 
have no connection to the world of [banking].

61
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:11,700
They operate in cash based societies with 
very little access to any international resources.

62
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:21,720
But they don't need banks. Two billion people are already
on the internet; with a simple application download,

63
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:28,920
they can become participants in an international
economy, using an international currency that...

64
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:32,880
can be transmitted anywhere with [little
or] no fees, and no government controls.

65
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:42,540
They can connect to a world of international,
peer-to-peer finance. Bitcoin is the money of the people.

66
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:49,600
[It operates according to] mathematical rules
that everyone agrees on. No [centralized] control.

67
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:57,260
Bring six and a half billion people into productive society,
connecting them to the rest of the world,

68
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:00,400
is truly revolutionary.

69
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:07,560
First, we will start by affecting the payment processors,
these enormous companies that make it...

70
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:13,380
more expensive to send money
the poorer the destination country is.

71
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:17,780
This situation is exploitative and corrupt.

72
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:26,580
These organizations profit enormously for a function 
that can be done in bitcoin for [little or no fee].

73
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:35,560
As an adage of the internet once went, I just replaced
your entire industry with a hundred lines of Python.

74
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:40,400
That is exactly what we will do with Bitcoin.

75
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:48,960
How can you use bitcoin today? Simply 
speaking, bitcoin can operate as a currency.

76
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,920
You can think of it as buying a foreign currency.

77
00:08:51,920 --> 00:09:00,680
You can connect to an exchange over the web,
wire some euros, and use them to buy bitcoin...

78
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,480
at the current exchange rate.

79
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:10,440
But that is not really the right way to do it. 
We are entrepreneurs, right? We want to disrupt.

80
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:17,340
The best way [to obtain bitcoin] is by 
finding a product or service you can offer...

81
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,880
that someone with bitcoin would want to buy.

82
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,580
Start by earning bitcoin.

83
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:32,740
If you want to start a business, there are 
two barriers to becoming a global business.

84
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:40,140
The first barrier: it is difficult to transport 
products and services across borders.

85
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:48,380
With the internet, we solved that. We can now create
products and services to sell that are virtual.

86
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:54,680
We could sell and deliver anywhere in the 
world, but we still had one big problem.

87
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:58,880
How do we get paid?
Bitcoin solves that part.

88
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:06,120
It allows us to receive payments from 
anywhere in the world, near instantaneously.

89
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:16,880
The Bitcoin network allows any individual to send
an amount as small one hundred millionth of a bitcoin,

90
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:23,000
which in today's terms is
a very tiny amount of money.

91
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,240
You can't do that with traditional
money and payment systems.

92
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:33,060
Credit cards were made in the 1950s, 
certainly not made for an internet age.

93
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,820
Bitcoin is made for the internet age.

94
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:43,520
If you can send payments that are one hundredth
or thousandth of a euro, you can sell content...

95
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,300
with microtransactions.

96
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:55,240
You can collect tiny payments from millions of people
and then aggregate them to be worth something.

97
00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:05,880
On the same network where you can send one
thousandth of a euro, you can send one billion euros.

98
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:12,460
The fee could be exactly the same, because
it depends on the size of the transaction in kilobytes,

99
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:15,500
not the [value of the money].

100
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:21,720
Let's look back at the internet, the lessons 
we learned, and why bitcoin is important.

101
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:26,120
One of the most important principles
on the internet is neutrality.

102
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:31,520
The internet doesn't distinguish between 
large organizations and small organizations.

103
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:36,960
It doesn't know the difference
between CNN and an Egyptian blogger.

104
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:46,380
It provides the opportunity for a blogger to speak to
the world with the same power of voice that CNN has.

105
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:52,840
Bitcoin is neutral to sender and recipient,
as well as to the value of a transaction.

106
00:11:52,840 --> 00:12:01,800
That means every citizen and user of 
Bitcoin has the ability to innovate in finance.

107
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:10,580
Instruments, payment systems, and currency,
with the same facilities that a bank has.

108
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:20,580
You can become Citibank.
That is truly revolutionary.

109
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:29,680
It [transforms] a hierarchical system of international
finance that achieved security by limiting access.

110
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:36,440
That is the method of "trust" on our payment systems.
You can't get in unless you are vetted.

111
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:44,920
Bitcoin turns that on its head, with a flat and
decentralized network where every node is equal.

112
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:51,640
The protocol is neutral to the transactions 
and pushes innovation to the edge of the network.

113
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:58,760
This creates the same phenomenon we saw
on the internet: innovation without permission.

114
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:04,800
You don't need to ask anyone for your 
application to be published on the internet.

115
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:11,280
You don't need to ask anyone to completely subvert
a new industry with your information technology.

116
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:18,660
On Bitcoin, you don't need to ask anyone to invent a
new financial instrument, payment system, or service.

117
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:25,300
You can just do it. You can just write the code.
You are now part of an international financial network.

118
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:30,540
You can run that code and come
in contact with millions of consumers.

119
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:40,620
Now, it is still early days. We don't yet have 
the polished interfaces. It is difficult to use.

120
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:53,120
[The media says] it is used by criminals,
but it is not easy to see who is using bitcoin.

121
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,140
I have heard all of those [accusations] before.

122
00:13:56,140 --> 00:14:05,800
When I was on the internet in 1991, it was "a den
of thieves," pornographers, pirates, and criminals.

123
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:13,640
But it didn't matter and it doesn't matter now,
because the same power of the technology,

124
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:21,440
used by a criminal to promote their criminal activities,
can be used by all the rest of us to do good,

125
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,620
to do incredible things all across the world.

126
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:35,340
There are more of us. Bitcoin creates an environment
that is ripe for innovation. It is not just a currency.

127
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:39,400
It is a technology, a network, and a currency.

128
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:47,440
I can tell you, I am very happy that bitcoin's price is
climbing. I own some bitcoins, and it feels kind of nice.

129
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,820
But I don't care about the price.
If Bitcoin crashed tomorrow morning,

130
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:56,500
the technology is still revolutionary.

131
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:07,220
If a website or application fails,
the internet doesn't go away.

132
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:13,860
If you understand that Bitcoin is a technology, not just
a currency, you can truly grasp its the importance.

133
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:21,700
Again, it is not just about us.
It is about the other six billion.

134
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:28,740
It is about bringing financial integration 
that the world has never seen before.

135
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:34,040
From our perspective, it is a great technology
we can use for disruptive Innovation.

136
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:37,260
We can build some interesting services.

137
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:47,040
If you are a Kenyan farmer raising money to buy seeds,
you can join in decentralized, peer-to-peer lending,

138
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:57,320
and reach out to lenders all across the globe.
This is not just a technology, it is life-changing.

139
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:05,860
The impact Bitcoin will have on the vast majority of the
world which lives under repressive and corrupt regimes,

140
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:11,280
with central banks that impose 
hyperinflation of 30% or more per month.

141
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:17,200
It is more important to see how
Bitcoin can affect all of those people.

142
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:21,960
There are two billion people on the internet;
only one billion of them have bank accounts.

143
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:25,880
We can change that. It will not be easy.

144
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:30,480
Make no mistake about it, when you 
[introduce] a disruptive technology into...

145
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:36,940
the middle of the most powerful organizations
[and governments] on the planet, they won't like it.

146
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:40,100
Right now, we are still in the early stages.

147
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:48,540
To use a trite expression, "First they ignore us, then
they laugh at us, then they fight us, and then we win."

148
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:53,460
We are still at the laughing stage,
and that is quite all right.

149
00:16:53,460 --> 00:17:00,480
By the time they start fighting us, they will have
already lost. This technology will be global.

150
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:07,400
More than $2.5 billion dollars has come from Chinese
investors who discovered a counterbalance...

151
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,980
to world domination by the global
reserve currency of the U.S. dollar.

152
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:18,540
There are about 180 currencies in the world,
but there is only one international currency.

153
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:26,840
There are about 180 currencies controlled by central
banks and governments, but only one is mathematical.

154
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:31,200
That is bitcoin. We will build more of them.

155
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,460
Cryptographic currencies will be
a mainstay of our financial future.

156
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:47,940
They will be part of the future of this planet.
They [can't be] uninvented, and it is as simple as that.

157
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:51,920
You cannot turn that omelet back into eggs.

158
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:58,020
There are already have more than
a hundred competing currencies.

159
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:03,920
This shows how quickly innovation has 
exploded beyond bitcoin the currency.

160
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:10,660
There are many alternative coins, altcoins as
they're known, that use the same basic technology:

161
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:18,340
a decentralized consensus network and an asset ledger.

162
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:27,060
There [can be] other forms of currency that are
inflationary or deflationary, that use demurrage...

163
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,100
or negative interest rates.

164
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:35,980
Currencies that redistribute a proportion
of the income to charitable organisations.

165
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:42,600
We can invent new forms of
money and financial instruments.

166
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,480
Bitcoin is programmable money.

167
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:51,360
Once you have programmable money,
the possibilities are truly endless.

168
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:58,140
Many of the basic concepts in our current 
system depend on legal contracts.

169
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:07,920
We can convert them into algorithmic contracts
that can be enforced on the Bitcoin network.

170
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:21,740
As I said before, there is no counterparty. If I choose to
send value to another part of the peer-to-peer network.

171
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,880
no one is in between.

172
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:31,260
if I invent a new form of money, I can deploy it
to the entire world and invite others to join me.

173
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:40,320
If you see that Bitcoin has the [potential]
to not only introduce money for the internet...

174
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:49,740
Because it is the perfect money for
the internet: instant, safe, and free.

175
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:56,800
Yes, it is money for the internet, but it is also
so much more. Bitcoin is the internet of money.

176
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:08,360
Currency is only the first application. If you grasp that,
you can look beyond the fad and the price volatility.

177
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:16,940
At its core, it is a revolutionary technology that will
change the world forever. Join me in this revolution.

178
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:26,800
Thank you. [Applause]
