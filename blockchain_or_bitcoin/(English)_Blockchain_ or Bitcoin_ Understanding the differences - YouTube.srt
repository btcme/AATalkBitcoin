00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:13,480
[ORGANISER] Andreas, please come up to the stage.
[Applause]

2
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:19,460
[ANDREAS] Hello everyone. 
Can you hear me well? Very good.

3
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:27,550
1. Bitcoin is dead. [Laughter] 
Bitcoin is just a silly idea.

4
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:37,710
It clearly can't work. It won't scale. 
It will fail. It has failed. It is dead.

5
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:44,190
The true innovation at the heart of this technology,
the blockchain, is what matters.

6
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:49,820
This technology will create new opportunities
in financial technology ("fintech") for banking

7
00:00:49,820 --> 00:01:01,260
and financial services companies across the world,
even while Bitcoin won't be able to succeed further.

8
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,680
2. Blockchain is a joke.
Blockchain doesn't actually work.

9
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:11,900
Bitcoin is the only thing that matters. 
Bitcoin will completely change banking.

10
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:18,500
It will make banking obsolete. All central banks
will be destroyed in the path of Bitcoin.

11
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:27,140
Within just a decade, every currency in the
world will be dominated by Bitcoin.

12
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:35,650
Both of these positions are ridiculous, simple-minded,
puerile, and fundamentally wrong.

13
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:43,300
For every complex question, there is one very
simple solution and it is wrong.

14
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:48,490
This is a very nuanced space. 
It is a space that is brand new.

15
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:53,200
It is a space that has existed for only seven years.

16
00:01:53,200 --> 00:02:00,640
Yes, it does represent something truly revolutionary:
a fundamental change in our understanding of trust,

17
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:08,620
in the way we organise authority from hierarchical systems to network-centric flat systems.

18
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:15,060
It is a re-imagining of what it means to have
currency, how currency derives its value.

19
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:21,620
It is a new system for disintermediating intermediaries. 
It is a re-balancing of world affairs.

20
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:28,580
All of these things are true, but we don't
really know how this is going to play out

21
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:32,000
-- which is the most exciting part of my job.

22
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,900
Bitcoin is one of the few spaces, one of the
few experiences I've ever had in my life,

23
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:44,879
where I feel that I am sitting on the front
rows of history, observing history in the making.

24
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:50,549
History is not the past, history is how we
change the present to affect the future.

25
00:02:50,549 --> 00:02:53,290
We are doing this right now worldwide.

26
00:02:53,290 --> 00:03:01,480
By "we," I don't just mean Bitcoin. 
I mean the much broader space.

27
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:11,120
Before we go to a very simplistic answer,
what is called in some spaces "Bitcoin maximalism,"

28
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:20,900
or the opposite extreme where we discount Bitcoin
as an unruly, rag-tag, anarcho-capitalist dream

29
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,909
that is silly on its face...

30
00:03:22,909 --> 00:03:30,180
Something that "serious" people, scientists
with PhDs, have said will soon die.

31
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:35,360
Before we go to these two extreme positions,
we really need to understand the nuance.

32
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,680
What is Bitcoin? 
What is the blockchain?

33
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,680
What do these things have at their very core
which gives them the characteristics they have?

34
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:49,409
How do you tell them apart? 
What are the differences between the systems?

35
00:03:49,409 --> 00:03:52,489
What applications do they have?

36
00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:57,720
My goal today is to really try to answer these questions.

37
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:02,720
What is Bitcoin? Bitcoin is the first blockchain.

38
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:08,199
Bitcoin is the largest open, global 
blockchain that exists today.

39
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:16,629
Bitcoin is the first borderless, transnational, open
system of access for financial payments and trust.

40
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:23,760
It enables innovation without permission, with high resistance to censorship, coercion,

41
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,680
and geopolitical manipulation.

42
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:34,280
Bitcoin is a mathematical proof system that is
fundamentally neutral to [the identity of] participants.

43
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:40,800
It exhibits a principle that on the internet
we call "net neutrality," and brings that to finance

44
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,220
-- which of course terrifies people.

45
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:51,740
Finance without concern for
source, destination, or amount?

46
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:57,120
Neutral routing of transactions, equal for everyone?

47
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,710
That idea is terrifying.

48
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:03,669
Where [is authority involved]? 
Where does trust come from?

49
00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:08,919
It's almost as if, suddenly, we no longer
pay attention to the New York Times.

50
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:13,550
Instead, anyone can publish
their opinion without an editor.

51
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:18,050
What will the world come to?

52
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:22,259
What the internet did for communication, 
bitcoin is doing for finance.

53
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:27,730
It is introducing a fundamentally different
network-centric and flat system which allows us

54
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:34,120
to do transactions without recourse to 
authority or intermediaries, that derives trust...

55
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:40,500
from the collaboration and computation
of thousands of nodes.

56
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:48,050
It uses a blockchain, but the blockchain is
one of several components that make Bitcoin work.

57
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:53,699
If you focus too much on the blockchain, 
you may miss the point.

58
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:56,440
What is the most important technology of the internet?

59
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:02,640
What is the really important invention
that makes the internet work?

60
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:09,660
TCP/IP? Packet-switching? TLS?

61
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:17,080
But to take the internet and consider it only
as a packet-switching network, means that

62
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:25,050
the internet and an intranet or your
local area network are equivalent.

63
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:28,050
Are they really?

64
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:33,260
Was the real opportunity to be able
to do packet-switched networks?

65
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:41,220
Or is the power of the internet the fact that
it is open, global, transnational, borderless,

66
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:49,160
censorship-resistant, open-access, and 
anyone can innovate without permission?

67
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,560
This is the crucial issue.

68
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:56,080
Where does the value of bitcoin derive from?

69
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,640
Yes, it is a blockchain, but it is a very special blockchain.

70
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:05,980
It is a blockchain that uses, as its fundamental
consensus mechanism, proof-of-work.

71
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:11,920
Proof-of-work gives it certain characteristics
that are unattainable, so far as we know,

72
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,640
with other consensus mechanisms.

73
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:21,569
Bitcoin is fundamentally open, borderless,
transnational, censorship-resistant, etc.

74
00:07:21,569 --> 00:07:28,389
All of these characteristics are both
what it is and what makes it powerful.

75
00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:38,480
Ironically, they are also the things that most critics
of Bitcoin point to as its greatest weaknesses.

76
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:44,419
"It cannot be allowed to exist if it is 
borderless and open to access."

77
00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:50,309
"If it has no ability to be controlled,
it cannot be allowed to exist!"

78
00:07:50,309 --> 00:08:01,460
Yet it exists. Bitcoin forgot to ask for permission.

79
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:09,720
Out of this grand experiment that has lasted
seven years, we now have this really disruptive force

80
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,759
that is pushing us to re-imagine payment networks.

81
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:23,510
Out of that, we [saw] the most brilliant marketing campaign in the history of disruptive technologies.

82
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:31,280
Imagine if you've invented a new disruptive
technology and within four or five years,

83
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:39,719
you manage to completely distract the incumbent
by persuading them to follow in your footsteps

84
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:44,420
and adopt the central premise of your technology
[under the assumption that they] can

85
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:47,540
"disrupt their own business from the inside-out."

86
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:53,320
If the Bitcoin community had presented banks
with the idea of blockchains (as some of us did)

87
00:08:53,320 --> 00:09:04,740
and said, "Put a billion dollars into training people
on how to do things our way and work in our space."

88
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:14,620
Someone should have gotten the Nobel prize
of marketing, the Oscar of disruptive distraction.

89
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:26,140
The truth is that the financial services environment seized on "Blockchain" because they saw within it

90
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:36,300
the possibility of using some elements 
of Bitcoin without being disrupted.

91
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:42,500
But the blockchain is not the
only thing that makes Bitcoin tick.

92
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:47,810
In this effort, we see many
similarities to the early internet.

93
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:53,160
In the early days of the internet, when companies
saw how it had no editorial control,

94
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:57,220
no centralised security mechanism,
no barriers to access...

95
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:01,910
This represented a terrifying departure 
from their model of IT.

96
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:10,940
As a result, most companies resisted and built
intranets using TCP/IP, with heavy firewalls all around

97
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:20,070
to separate them, keep them controlled,
give them editorial access, and "tame" the system.

98
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:31,680
They ended up with these stagnant islands
which gradually became less and less secure.

99
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:38,180
Then we had the second wave of the internet, where
many of the most effective and disruptive companies

100
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:45,520
in the space took their internal IT infrastructure,
turned it inside-out to face the world,

101
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:55,860
put everything on the internet, and fully harnessed
the collaborative potential of keeping an open system.

102
00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:06,500
We no longer live in a world of Oracle and IBM, in a world
[dominated by] enterprise computing and software.

103
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:10,490
Apple is driving your IT faster than Oracle.

104
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:14,720
Your systems are inside-out or they are stagnant.

105
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,920
Collaboration is the name of the game.

106
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:22,300
The most robust and secure systems are the
ones that are on the internet, subject to attack

107
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:26,300
and competitive disruption every single day.

108
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:30,680
Through that process, they become more robust.

109
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:39,270
It is ironic that 15-20 years later, we're repeating
this conversation with the blockchain.

110
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:45,800
The question is: if TCP/IP isn't the magic
sauce, but the really interesting aspect is

111
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:53,139
the open-access, collaborative, global network,
does that mean that intranets are useless?

112
00:11:53,139 --> 00:12:00,250
Does that mean that TCP/IP on your LAN or
your datacenter has no value? Of course not.

113
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:06,100
These are still powerful technologies
and useful models of adopting.

114
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:11,630
However, the best thing you can do with an
intranet is inter-connect it to other intranets.

115
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:15,380
For that, you need the internet.

116
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:23,730
Bitcoin is the internet of money. 
Bitcoin is the de facto money of the internet.

117
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:28,139
Does that mean that Bitcoin will
always be the internet of money?

118
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:29,140
No.

119
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:35,850
Does that mean that Bitcoin will always be
the de facto money of the internet? No.

120
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:44,120
What is special about Bitcoin is that it represents
the open blockchain; the blockchain that offers

121
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:49,029
anonymity, censorship resistance, open access,
and innovation without permission.

122
00:12:49,029 --> 00:12:54,209
That engine creates an explosion
of innovative potential.

123
00:12:54,209 --> 00:13:00,180
It connects the vast number of under-banked
and un-banked people around the world.

124
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:06,900
About 4 billion people could become connected,
through a simple Android phone

125
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:14,740
or a simpler Nokia text-messaging phone, 
to the global financial network.

126
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:20,339
The open blockchain will change this world.

127
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:27,540
Today, there is one open blockchain that matters,
and that is Bitcoin.

128
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:35,960
I can't predict that it will always be the only 
open blockchain that matters, or the dominant one.

129
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:40,879
Why? Because it might not be "the best."

130
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:44,800
But very often, in technology, "the best" is not what wins.

131
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,160
TCP/IP wasn't "the best."

132
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:57,319
In fact, we now realise that it had fundamental
problems in scaling, in addressing, in routing,

133
00:13:57,319 --> 00:13:59,510
and many other things.

134
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:07,860
Yet TCP/IP was good enough at scale, with
network effect, so fast that it became irreplaceable.

135
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:10,600
It has now become un-upgradeable.

136
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:18,129
TCP/IP is so embedded into global networking
that it resists its own upgrade to IPv6,

137
00:14:18,129 --> 00:14:22,880
and has resisted its own upgrade for almost 20 years.

138
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:29,300
"IPv6 is coming."
IPv6 has been coming since 1995.

139
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:42,080
[Laughter] Any day now... But clearly, IPv4 is dead
and the internet can't possibly scale beyond Usenet

140
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:58,089
to email and attachments, to voice, to video,
to HD video, to Oculus VR 3D 4K capabilities.

141
00:14:58,089 --> 00:15:00,110
Of course it possibly can't.

142
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:06,440
It doesn't for a while, until it does, and then 
we shift the goal of what "scaling" means again.

143
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:17,690
Bitcoin can't scale to Visa, until it does. Bitcoin can't
scale to a global transactional network, until it does.

144
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:25,180
But I can tell you what Bitcoin can scale to: 
a $7-10 billion secure transnational network

145
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:31,780
that remains up and running for 24 hours per day,
365 days per year, for seven years

146
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:36,800
without a single successful attack
against the core protocol.

147
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:43,840
Not because there have been no attempts, but because
Bitcoin has been under attack from the first day,

148
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:49,880
for 24 hours per day, [365 days per year], by some of the
most sophisticated adversaries the world has seen.

149
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:56,980
[How do I know this]? Because Bitcoin has 
a $7 billion security bounty for breaking it.

150
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:10,102
It is a system that is on the internet and lives right in the
dirt, in the warzone of internet security, and it survives.

151
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:17,689
As it survives, it gets stronger every day.

152
00:16:17,689 --> 00:16:24,829
If that's what Bitcoin is, maybe this will be 
the one that becomes the internet of money.

153
00:16:24,829 --> 00:16:27,889
I can't predict that.

154
00:16:27,889 --> 00:16:37,080
What I can tell you without any uncertainty,
is that the world of finance will forever be dominated

155
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:46,460
within less than two decades by open, global, transnational, censorship-resistant, largely anonymous,

156
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:54,660
privacy-protected payment networks 
based on the exact model of Bitcoin.

157
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,670
With optimisations.

158
00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:09,220
Maybe it will be something unrecognisable from
what we still call Bitcoin, but the brand still works.

159
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:12,820
Or maybe we'll call it something else.

160
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:20,000
I remember, when I was in IT, how people kept
telling me that Ethernet would not scale beyond 1Mb,

161
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,980
then 10Mb, then 100Mb, then 1Gb.

162
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:29,540
"It could never scale." Yet today,
we're running 10Gb Ethernet over fibre.

163
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:35,310
Think about it for a second:
what part of that is still Ethernet?

164
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:41,780
The brand, the frame size, and
the physical address maybe.

165
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:47,540
The switching algorithm? Nope.
The distribution mechanism? Nope.

166
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:52,770
The network topology? Nope. 
None of that is the same.

167
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:57,560
What survived is the brand. 
We still call "Ethernet" what we have today.

168
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,250
Therefore the question is: did Ethernet scale?

169
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:04,430
Sure did, as long as you keep
changing what you call Ethernet.

170
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:07,180
Can Bitcoin scale? It depends.

171
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:11,980
What are the characteristics that
define Bitcoin, unalterably?

172
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:20,860
The 21 million coin limit and predictable issuance rate.
That is Bitcoin. You cannot change that.

173
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:25,800
The proof-of-work algorithm that is decentralised
with pseudonymous participants? That is Bitcoin.

174
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:31,890
You cannot change that. 
Everything else is up for negotiation.

175
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:35,220
We're going to maintain anonymity and privacy. 
We're going to empower the world.

176
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:45,680
We're going to distribute these powerful tools
of finance to everyone who has a smartphone.

177
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:54,390
When you think about this, we're not talking about
everyone with a smartphone having a bank account.

178
00:18:54,390 --> 00:19:03,570
We're talking about everyone with a smartphone
having a bank, of which they are the CEO.

179
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:13,360
A bank with the potential of international wiring
and settlement, market-making, loan origination

180
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:25,080
and termination, liquidity generation, and many other
capabilities that today even many banks don't have.

181
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:34,260
One day, a decade or so from now, a six-year-old
will be able to open a "bank" on their phone

182
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:43,280
and become a "banker," perhaps even issue
their own currency and become a "central banker."

183
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:52,690
That sounds insane, but that is absolutely
the world in which we now live, with the possibility

184
00:19:52,690 --> 00:20:02,060
that any individual on this planet can issue an
unforgeable, global, secure, instantaneous currency.

185
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:07,550
The recipe exists. Will it be Bitcoin or
will it be something else? I don't know.

186
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:16,840
But it will be an open, global, private, censorship-
resistant, transactional and transnational network.

187
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:28,440
Then the question becomes: what are we going to do
with blockchains? What's going to happen to the banks?

188
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:36,800
Some of the banks will adapt. Blockchains 
may have some very interesting applications.

189
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:47,410
Blockchains have certain useful characteristics as a
technology. In general, blockchains are not an answer.

190
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:55,690
If you say, "I have a blockchain," what that
prompts me to do is ask you questions.

191
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:58,070
It opens many questions.

192
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:06,560
For example, what is the consensus algorithm? 
What is the control / governance structure?

193
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:15,310
What is the model for currency or token generation? 
Who has the authority for issuance?

194
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:18,750
What are the characteristics for security?

195
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:22,890
If you start asking those questions, you can
decide what type of blockchain this is.

196
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:28,880
Is it open or closed? Does it use proof-of-work
or a different consensus algorithm?

197
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:35,300
Are we talking about a "proof-of-authority," 
signing instead of mining,

198
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:42,000
centralised as a consensus consortium 
between five or six banks, for example?

199
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:49,080
A closed, permission-based access
model for specific participants?

200
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,200
Maybe that's what we're looking at.

201
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:57,180
But when you're talking about that, you need to
understand what the limitations of that technology are.

202
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:59,270
What does it do and what does it not do?

203
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:09,420
Just because it is a blockchain doesn't mean
it will do everything that you think it will do.

204
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:17,340
If I take a Formula One car that is beautifully designed
for [driving] on a circuit, I could say...

205
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:21,600
this car can go 250 miles per hour.

206
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:26,530
Fantastic, but on what road?

207
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:32,270
If I take it into downtown Milan, my average speed
will be 15 miles per hour because of traffic.

208
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:36,100
But even if, for whatever miraculous reason,
the road ahead of me opened up and I tried

209
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:43,190
to go 250 miles per hour, the car would disintegrate
because of the road surface conditions.

210
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:47,200
Just because it is a powerful vehicle doesn't
mean that if you put it in a different context,

211
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,740
it can still operate.

212
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:53,200
It has to be suited for the purpose.

213
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,330
Let's examine some of the nuances. 
First of all, immutability.

214
00:22:57,330 --> 00:23:03,060
One of the things that people suggest blockchains
have as an inherent characteristic is immutability.

215
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:10,140
[As in], once you can record something on
a ledger, it cannot be changed.

216
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:13,920
But immutability is not a characteristic of blockchains;

217
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:22,600
immutability is an artefact of
a proof-of-work consensus system.

218
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:32,480
The open blockchain, Bitcoin, has immutability
because even if you control 100% of the mining power,

219
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:37,460
you cannot recreate an alternative version of history

220
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:41,960
by re-writing the blockchain without
also presenting valid proof-of-work.

221
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,110
That needs to be computed.

222
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:52,060
You can only affect, with the most immense amount of computation (hundreds of hexahashes per second)...

223
00:23:52,060 --> 00:24:03,370
Let's say you did have that.
You could now affect hundreds of blocks.

224
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:14,110
You could re-write the history of this afternoon,
but not yesterday, certainly not last week,

225
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:16,540
and most certainly not last year.

226
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:20,140
Even if you controlled all the hashing power
currently in the world, it is impossible

227
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:25,980
to re-write the proof-of-work on the Bitcoin
blockchain even two days in the past.

228
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:30,120
The amount of computation is unfathomable.

229
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:36,710
You'd have to wait for everybody else to stop doing
[proof-of-work as well], while you re-calculate the past.

230
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:44,920
They will continue into the future, creating a longer
blockchain, while you waste resources re-writing history.

231
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:49,700
Immutability is a characteristic of
proof-of-work, not blockchains.

232
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:52,960
That has some very serious implications.

233
00:24:52,960 --> 00:25:04,960
Censorship resistance and coercion resistance [depend
on] the anonymous and decentralised nature of mining.

234
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,920
If you combine those two facts, you
come up with some weird characteristics.

235
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:12,520
Let's say you have a consortium consensus
mechanism that controls banking.

236
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:17,420
I don't know why you would apply that, but
let's say you built a blockchain that uses six banks,

237
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:25,420
signing transactions in a round-robin fashion
or sophisticated Byzantine consensus model that

238
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:32,170
you bought at great expense from a consultant.
[Laughter]

239
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:37,900
What happens when you are served with a judicial
order to re-write the history of the last year

240
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:44,690
and make the balance in the bank 
account of WikiLeaks go to zero?

241
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:51,200
What happens if you're not served with a judicial
order, but simply blackmailed through market pressure

242
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,400
or by a regulator to do that?

243
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,960
Not that it would ever happen...

244
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:02,900
I mean, in a democracy we don't just cut off the finances
of WikiLeaks without any judicial process, do we?

245
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:06,180
[Laughter]

246
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:10,360
The problem is that you can actually coerce
the participants in this system to re-write

247
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,340
the financial history of transactions.

248
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:17,180
That represents a moral hazard
of extreme proportions.

249
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:22,820
The next question is: why would you use 
such a thing for a settlement system?

250
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:27,330
This is something that mystifies me.

251
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:36,780
SWIFT is an antiquated pain in the butt, expensive,
slow, and mired in geopolitical control.

252
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:44,940
The equity clearing systems are not as bad,
but they're still expensive and slow.

253
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,900
Certainly, you're directing a lot of profit.

254
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:56,820
Why not just implement a banking consortium
that does settlement internally? Well, I have an idea.

255
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:03,040
One of the things with a centralised clearinghouse
is that they have maximum transactional efficiency

256
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:08,280
(billions of transactions per second is no problem).

257
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:11,220
A blockchain can't replicate that level of efficiency.

258
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:14,070
There's no way you can do it. 
Physically it is impossible.

259
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:17,490
But let's say you [ignore that].

260
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:26,660
What you're saying is that you're going to replace
a party that has no fiduciary interest in the equities

261
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:32,670
and instruments that they're clearing,
that is not a market maker and participant,

262
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:37,510
that is completely independent by design,
that gives you some guarantee of neutrality

263
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:44,200
through separation of concerns and duties...
with a consortium of five banks that are themselves

264
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:49,480
market makers and participants and
have enormous conflict of interest?

265
00:27:49,480 --> 00:28:02,150
Until now at least, the brokerage game is gamed
with front-running, algorithmic trading, and dark pools.

266
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:11,970
The futures' game is rigged, the foreign exchange
game is rigged, but at least the settlement game isn't.

267
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:17,610
You're going to give that to a consortium
of banks to do without any oversight?

268
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:25,820
You're going to do this with a blockchain
that has full encryption, complete anonymity?

269
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:27,250
Well, that's a double-edged sword.

270
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:31,380
But if you make it fully transparent, then
the first time that Anonymous gets in to that market

271
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:36,910
and leaks that blockchain, forget the Panama Papers!

272
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:41,830
This is Panama Terabytes! [Laughter] 
Every transaction ever made.

273
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:48,920
I would love to see the black budgets of some
governments come out when their blockchain leaks.

274
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,890
How do you protect the keys?

275
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:55,270
How do you protect the keys that are used
to sign in this consensus algorithm?

276
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:59,370
You're creating an enormous concentration
of risk there, from a security perspective.

277
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:08,740
If those keys are stolen, even just as a denial-of-service
attack, that would lead to disastrous consequences.

278
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:14,400
But that's okay, right? Banks know
how to keep information secret...

279
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,680
Oh wait, not even the NSA can do that.

280
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:25,100
There is no system in the world we can design
that can keep information secret forever.

281
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:32,540
Bitcoin's answer is to decentralise the power so
massively, as much as possible, that there is no place

282
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:40,920
to press a button / pull the lever and
exert control, to force the system.

283
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:44,780
The whole point is decentralisation.

284
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:49,740
Blockchains can effectively decentralise 
big parts of the financial system.

285
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:55,370
They will absolutely generate cost-savings for banks.

286
00:29:55,370 --> 00:30:01,040
They will affect the margins, increase efficiency.

287
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:05,650
Like intranets, they will be very useful tools...

288
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:10,620
In fact, I think you should implement an overlay
blockchain on top of Bitcoin for settlement

289
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:17,660
and replace SWIFT, swiftly! [Laughter]

290
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:20,080
In the end, it doesn't matter.

291
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:27,740
I'm not critical of blockchains because I am morally or
ideologically opposed to banks continuing business.

292
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:33,460
I think banks have bigger problems than Bitcoin.

293
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:41,700
I have some questions about the practicality
and applicability of blockchains without proof-of-work

294
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:47,960
and decentralisation; blockchains that
are closed and not open to access,

295
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,780
which don't have permission-less innovation.

296
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:57,500
I don't think [that kind of blockchain]
really delivers on the promise.

297
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:02,190
In the end, I really don't care.

298
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:12,230
I'm not interested in the 1% marginal decrease in cost
of a settlement platform for interbank this and that.

299
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:14,500
I don't care.

300
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:18,900
There are four billion people who are under-banked.

301
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:22,520
With an open blockchain, we can change that.

302
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:41,040
That is the team I'm on. Thank you. [Applause]

303
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,670
[ORGANISER] Thank you, Andreas. 
[ANDREAS] Thank you.

304
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:48,850
[ORGANISER] Thank you for your compelling
view on the relationship between Bitcoin,

305
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:52,320
blockchain, and the future of our central banks.

306
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:57,520
We have a representative right here from the
bank of Italy, the payment systems, the currency

307
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:08,640
we have in our wallet, our financial 
institution clients, and us as consultants.

308
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:16,820
Before we go on to the next speaker, as you are
so knowledgeable about Bitcoin, I have a question

309
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:21,380
on the compelling story of the day.

310
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:25,270
Who do you think is Satoshi Nakamoto? Do you know?

311
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:31,720
[Laughter] I have to inform you that
we have journalists in the room, so...

312
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:37,440
[ANDREAS] I don't know. I don't care. It doesn't matter.

313
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:42,720
Bitcoin is not a system of proof by authority,
or even reference to authority.

314
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:48,020
It is a system of independent,
neutral, mathematical proof.

315
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:57,520
What that means is that it stands on its own
without appeal to its author or creator.

316
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:07,220
I have no idea who Euclid was, or even if Euclid existed.

317
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:15,080
Euclidean geometry is part of my daily life
whether Euclid existed or not, whether Euclid

318
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:24,180
was a group of people or an individual, whether
Euclid was a nasty malicious pervert or a saint.

319
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:32,740
It doesn't matter. Some people will say, 
"Yes but Satoshi Nakamoto has one million bitcoins."

320
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:39,880
"What happens if Satoshi Nakamoto sells 
all one million bitcoins in one moment?"

321
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:45,260
I'm a bit more worried about what happens if China's
central bank sells all of their dollars in one moment.

322
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:49,120
[Laughter] Percentage-wise, that's a bigger problem!

323
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,880
What happens if Saudi Arabia decides to...

324
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:56,460
change fundamental supply 
characteristics of oil in one moment?

325
00:33:56,460 --> 00:34:06,790
What happens if the Walmart family decides the yuan
is a better investment and they exit the dollar?

326
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:09,940
Market fundamentals mean
that [Satoshi doesn't] matter.

327
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:13,440
Bitcoin survives regardless.

328
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:19,020
The only thing the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto is guaranteed to deliver is sensationalist articles...

329
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:21,880
that give us more appeal to authority.

330
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:29,880
In the end, Bitcoin is not governed by Satoshi Nakamoto. 
Bitcoin is governed by algorithms.

331
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:33,840
Thank you. 
[ORGANISER] Thank you, Andreas. [Applause]

332
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,200
[ANDREAS] Do we have any time for questions?

333
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:40,120
[ORGANISER] We have many questions from
the audience. As there are so many of you

334
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:45,100
and time is passing quickly, I would
like for you to read one of them

335
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:57,049
and maybe [answer the rest] later on. 
Otherwise we wouldn't have time for the next speaker.

336
00:34:57,049 --> 00:35:02,220
Is there any question you would like to answer?

337
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:12,520
[ANDREAS] Let me see, just one second. 
[ORGANISER] Sure.

338
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:19,180
[ANDREAS] I think "will the success of blockchains
be defined by a push factor from the market...

339
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:24,720
or a pull factor" is happening now.

340
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:36,820
I'd like to shift that a tiny bit and talk about the
global open blockchain, Bitcoin, as it exists today.

341
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:43,670
I had said that we "forgot to ask for permission,"
but we also don't need support.

342
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:49,880
This is not a system that is going to work
better if banks support it and back it.

343
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:55,700
It is not a system that is going to have an
increase in trust if we add intermediaries.

344
00:35:55,700 --> 00:36:00,650
It is not a system that will become better
if we add identity and reputation systems,

345
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:04,280
thereby replicating the problems of the past.

346
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:16,900
It [does not intend] to replace Visa for a developed
nation consumer buying a cup of coffee at Starbucks.

347
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:22,520
That is not the point. It is not a system
that will replace national currencies.

348
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:28,820
Bitcoin will effect import / export businesses,
international remittances, in-sourcing and

349
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:33,220
out-sourcing, and cross-border transactions
where the friction is greatest.

350
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:37,580
It will serve those who are not being served by banks.

351
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:44,230
Bitcoin is irrelevant to banks
because they cannot use it.

352
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:49,500
They cannot use it because banks are fundamentally
imprisoned within a regulatory system that

353
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:55,099
does not permit them to use systems without identity.

354
00:36:55,099 --> 00:37:01,700
Outside of that prison are four billion people who
don't have identity, who can't be a part of that system.

355
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:04,029
But they can use Bitcoin.

356
00:37:04,029 --> 00:37:08,240
They don't care about banking, and 
banking doesn't care about them.

357
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:14,200
Thank you. [Applause]
