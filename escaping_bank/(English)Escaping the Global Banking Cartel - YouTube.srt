1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,680
What do you call it when a bunch of companies collude
to set prices, fix markets, close off competition,

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,720
capture regulators, and bribe politicians?

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,760
[AUDIENCE shouting answers]

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:19,480
We call it a "cartel," right? Like the oil cartel.
You have heard of that term before, "cartel"?

5
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:27,020
Who here has heard of the term 'banking cartel'?
[Laughter] Oh, we don't hear that term.

6
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:32,080
We don't talk about the banking cartel.
We don't talk about the information cartel.

7
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:36,540
All right... how many of you here in Seattle work
for one of the information cartel companies?

8
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:43,960
[Laughter] Uh-huh... Big smile on the box.

9
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:51,080
Cartels are the most insidious when we don't talk about
them, when they hide in the shadows but in plain view.

10
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:56,520
The banking system, payments, finance
are the biggest cartels in the world.

11
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,320
Nobody calls them a cartel because
they're the biggest cartel in the world.

12
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:10,280
They own all of the media channels, politicians and laws;
that makes it easy for them to get away with crimes.

13
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,760
In fact, mega-crimes.

14
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:27,060
Just after the crisis in 2008, instead of some bankers
going to jail, they set up an additional layer of crime:

15
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,760
a series of fraudulent foreclosures called robo-signing.

16
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:38,080
Do you remember that crisis? One of the lead
companies in that space, the biggest robo-signer of all,

17
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,300
was run by a guy called Steven Mnuchin.

18
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:48,460
Anybody know what that guy does today?
He is the Treasury Secretary [of the United States].

19
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:53,900
Apparently he can do that job
without running it from a jail cell...

20
00:01:53,900 --> 00:02:02,540
He copped a deal, didn't have to accept any 
wrong-doing, and then quickly got a cozy job.

21
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:10,240
Now he has the ultimate level of protection, which
is qualified immunity. That is how cartels work.

22
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,160
First they capture the market.

23
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:19,660
Then they capture the regulators (who are 
always, of course, about "consumer protection").

24
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:26,540
The regulator is there to protect against "evil things"
happening. For example, money laundering.

25
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:32,860
If you don't have a banking license,
no money laundering for you!

26
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:40,900
But if you do have a banking license... Well, I mean
we [must] protect "the system." There will be a fine.

27
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:48,860
Usually the fine will be less than what you made actually
money laundering. You will get away with it, right?

28
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:53,160
Of course, we don't want to see
any financing of terrorists...

29
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,600
except for the ones we do through the 
State Department, the CIA, or the banks...

30
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,700
-- in which case, those are good people.

31
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,360
We have the regulators and they are captured.

32
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:12,880
That kind of situation encourages behaviours
that are fundamentally parasitic.

33
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:19,980
When capitalism fails in this particular mode,
when you end up with full-blown crony capitalism,

34
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,900
it is also known as kleptocracy.

35
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:31,040
"Kleptocracy" is from the Greek word 'klepto,'
which means thief, and 'krátos' which means power.

36
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:43,540
The thieves are in power, literally. That is kleptocracy,
when the most parasitic behaviours get rewarded.

37
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:49,380
It's actually not about competing. When you run a
business at that scale, it is not about competing.

38
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:58,680
It is about finding the biggest pipe, the 
biggest flow, of money in the economy,

39
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:05,040
straddling that pipe, sticking a straw in it, 
and sucking as much of that money out as you can.

40
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:14,140
You establish yourself as a parasitic leech on a flow
of money, which describes the entire banking system.

41
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:24,600
The idea is, you find a job that requires an intermediary;
it requires an intermediary because you made sure to...

42
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:32,260
buy some lawyers, some Congress people to write a law,
to make it require an intermediary (specifically, you).

43
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:39,040
Then you stick a straw into that flow of money and
start extracting rents. It's called rent-seeking behavior.

44
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:44,500
You take half a percentage point here,
half a percentage point there...

45
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,560
We have this wonderful thing called 
"fractional reserve banking."

46
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:54,480
If you try to describe it to a five-year-old, they would
probably turn around and say, "That sounds like fraud!"

47
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,600
[Laughter] They would be right.

48
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:04,600
Of course, there is a big difference
between fraud and something that is "legal."

49
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:10,020
It depends on which politicians you buy
to make sure it is [considered] legal.

50
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:17,280
We have these parasitic companies, sitting on
top of these flows of money, extracting rent.

51
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:30,980
They create this rent-seeking behavior. In doing so, they
disrupt competition by buying and suing competitors,

52
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:36,000
or even better making sure that 
competitors can't keep up with regulation.

53
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:43,680
[They capture] regulators [to keep] the competition
at bay. In doing that, they have built a cartel.

54
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:51,160
Then they make sure nobody calls it a cartel. Instead,
we call it "the shining example of American capitalism."

55
00:05:51,160 --> 00:06:01,300
The end result of this would be appalling in its own self.
Obviously, this is not a good model to run an economy.

56
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,520
It is not a competitive model to run an economy.

57
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:13,940
But who does it really hurt? Does it matter if a bunch of
people get obscenely rich without having to compete?

58
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:23,220
Does it really matter? Well, to most people in a
semi-functioning thriving economy, it doesn't matter.

59
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:34,820
That is the magic. Until money breaks, part of the benefit
of freedom, the premium of liberty, is the ability...

60
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,580
to not give a shit about how any of it works.

61
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:41,700
You don't need to worried about these 
details; you live in a free country.

62
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:48,120
You're free to instead pay attention to Sunday football,
enjoy your life, and have another hot dog.

63
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,940
But when money stops working,
suddenly all of it comes crashing back.

64
00:06:52,940 --> 00:07:05,420
You have to start learning some new vocabulary.
At the end of 2008, we all had to start learning.

65
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:16,640
"Grandma, what is a credit default swap?" "I don't know.
Let's ask Uncle John. He has a degree in finance."

66
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:23,080
He doesn't know either. [Laughter] Half of the people in
the business didn't now what a credit default swap was,

67
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:27,440
how it worked, or what was hiding behind it.

68
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:33,460
Suddenly, everybody needs to know what a credit default
swap is, because apparently it chewed a giant hole...

69
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,340
right in the middle of the economy.

70
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:45,740
When money stops working, everything stops working.
You are on a crash course to learn whose fault it was.

71
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:53,780
There are two alternative histories. In one of
these histories, there were some oopsies.

72
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,380
Some things happened.

73
00:07:55,380 --> 00:08:01,520
People made some bad mistakes, but- you know...
They are just people trying to do their job.

74
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:09,000
In the end, it was mostly the fault of greedy homeowners
who didn't read the fine print carefully enough,

75
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,920
to realize they were buying a ballooning interest rate.

76
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,640
They had the audacity to want to own a home.

77
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:23,260
Because of these greedy people, the real-estate
market had an oopsie. But don't worry!

78
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:31,640
The irresponsible people had their homes taken away
from them. The banks got some cash infusions,

79
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,640
which we don't want to talk about too much...

80
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:39,740
But everything was fixed, we passed some laws and
it [will] not happen again. Really, it was just a blip.

81
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:43,420
In the next ten years, we will just
rebuild everything. Everybody is happy.

82
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:47,980
Now we have a roaring economy that is working great!

83
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,860
That is [the first story].

84
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:56,600
[The second story] may be familiar to more of you,
who are probably in the middle class.

85
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:06,280
They robbed us blind, strip-mined the economy, had an
orgy of fraud, and knew exactly what they were doing.

86
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:13,940
There are mountains and mountains of evidence
that the least competent RICO lawyer could use...

87
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:19,260
to unravel the entire thing and send five 
hundred people to jail for twenty-five years.

88
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:26,460
That was ignored because we [must] "save the system."
Otherwise, the system would crush us all.

89
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:34,340
We dumped more than $10 trillion in an 
orgy of quantitative easing into the banks,

90
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:41,120
which they did not use to stimulate any part of the
economy, but instead to blow another giant bubble...

91
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:48,900
into real-estate, into the stock market, into bonds,
into student loans, into sub-prime [auto insurance],

92
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,040
into every part of the economy.

93
00:09:52,040 --> 00:10:00,400
[Meanwhile], they made sure those cops beat
the shit out of anyone who had the audacity...

94
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:05,460
to protest as part of Occupy Wall Street.

95
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:11,980
That didn't work. They turned protest into a crime.

96
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:17,240
They didn't just damage the economy,
they raped the rule of law in this country...

97
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,700
and destroyed the justice system
so they could get away with it.

98
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:26,960
We have come full circle today.
Ten years later, where are we?

99
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:33,160
Ten trillion dollars in debt, ten more giant bubbles.

100
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:47,400
It will happen again, because a system like that is
fragile and corrupt; architected in such a way as to...

101
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:54,040
reward and encourage that kind of behavior.

102
00:10:54,040 --> 00:11:03,560
In a system of incentives where the penalty is less
than the profits you made by committing the crime,

103
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,720
that is legal immunity.

104
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:17,060
That is a very loud signal, in a system of capitalism,
that says, "Do it again. Only this time, leverage more!"

105
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:22,800
"We could probably squeeze out another ten years."

106
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,440
A lot of solutions have been proposed to this.

107
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,960
The problem with destroying
institutions within a society:

108
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:38,500
many people whose livelihoods
get functionally destroyed, will rage.

109
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:46,440
That rage gets misdirected. There is an old adage
of the rich guy who has ninety-nine cookies...

110
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,520
the middle-class having one cookie, and 
the rich guy saying to [them], "Watch it."

111
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:57,840
"That brown guy will take your cookie."
That is the oldest trick in the game.

112
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,340
I'll just give you one little piece of information.

113
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:07,880
One of the houses stolen by Steven Mnuchin's
robo-signing firm belonged to the guy

114
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,740
-- I won't name him because
they don't deserve to be named --

115
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:19,680
who sent seventeen bombs to Congress 
people just a couple of weeks ago.

116
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,780
That guy was robo-closed by Steven Mnuchin...

117
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:29,720
and decided to turn his rage against immigrants,
gays, and Democrats, for I don't know what.

118
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:37,440
The point is, when you have that kind of destruction
in a society, when you destroy the rule of law

119
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,300
and create rage among people,
they don't know where to turn.

120
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:49,540
What you get is violence, extremism, bigotry, hatred
and a desperate desire to find someone to blame.

121
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:55,800
Of course, you can't really blame those guys because
they are behind very tall walls with very good security.

122
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,080
The guillotines are out of fashion.

123
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:03,140
They tried that in France, but we can't do it again
because we are now a civilised country.

124
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,940
So what do you do?

125
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:15,600
Protest? That ends in an orgy of violence by militarised
police, exactly what police have always done.

126
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:23,640
You can't do that. Occupy? That was tried. Again, an
orgy of violence. A lot of young voters tried apathy.

127
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:29,700
"I don't give a shit. These old people fucked it up.
I will just go and play my game and ignore all of this."

128
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,300
That doesn't work out very well.

129
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:40,620
Trying to become part of the parasitic class by
clawing your way to just escape from the middle class?

130
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:48,069
Well, there is a tide of shit coming out behind you
and it is moving faster than you are.

131
00:13:48,069 --> 00:13:50,800
The middle class is sliding backwards so fast that,

132
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:56,600
while you try to scramble out of it, you are 
still backsliding, so that doesn't work.

133
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:02,600
How do we fix this problem? The first thing we
 need to do, is identify why this keeps happening.

134
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:12,260
In my opinion, looking at this from a technology
perspective, architecture is at the core of the problem.

135
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:18,380
An architecture of hierarchy and 
centralisation is responsible for this.

136
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:28,300
Parasitic behavior gets rewarded because there are
centralised flows of money that someone can tap into.

137
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:38,620
We have taken the traditional model of commerce --
where you visit, interact, and trade with [other people]...

138
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:45,440
around you in your community, a system of peer-to-peer
commerce -- and we converted it into a system...

139
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:51,540
that I call a peer-to-corporation-
to-corporation-to-peer system.

140
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:59,520
When I pay my butcher, Visa, Chase,
and three other banks get involved.

141
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:07,960
They all stick a little straw in that flow. By the time
[the money] reaches my butcher, it is a lot less.

142
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:13,000
How can you make a system
like that work? It is absurd.

143
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:20,160
You would need to create a sense of apathy, combined
with the convenience of waving a piece of plastic.

144
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:28,140
[You would need to] create a dark cloud 
over cash ("terrorists!") and pretend...

145
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:33,540
it is something we should get rid of, 
because people [might] use it to evade taxes.

146
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:39,100
Of course, the people who evade taxes use corporations,
very expensive lawyers, and actually get away with it.

147
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:46,260
But the butcher might evade some taxes
if we use cash, so we'll eradicate cash...

148
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:51,640
That hierarchy is not just poisonous for
the system of commerce that we have.

149
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,440
It is not just our banking system.

150
00:15:54,440 --> 00:16:02,560
It becomes a haven for parasites because the
very architecture itself concentrates power,

151
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,120
creates a reward system for parasitic behavior.

152
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,920
This is now happening with information cartels.

153
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:15,040
"Let's take everyone's identity, put it in a big pot,
put Mark Zuckerberg on top [of the pot], and..."

154
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:21,680
"Oops - we fucked up our electoral system..."
[Laughter] "But we have cat videos!"

155
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,720
"Hey, democracy is dying-" "But we have cat videos!"

156
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,580
That is okay, is it?

157
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:35,780
The information cartels, the payment 
cartels, and the electoral system are...

158
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:43,020
so centralised, that the Secretary of State in Georgia can
run in his own election and steal it at the same time.

159
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:50,060
We have electronic voting machines making it so quick
that you can count the votes incorrectly in an hour,

160
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:54,620
instead of counting them correctly over three days.

161
00:16:54,620 --> 00:17:00,020
We have convenience. You can tap on the screen to vote,
but the system changes your vote to something else,

162
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:03,200
and it is still counted, instantly!

163
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:07,160
Convenience! And democracy dies a little.

164
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:15,820
We have the liberty to ignore most of these remote
negative side-effects that arise out of centralisation.

165
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:22,820
In this country we have an incredible 
amount of economic momentum...

166
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:27,200
and a dirty deal with the Saudis
to sell oil only for U.S. dollars.

167
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:33,020
That ensures we will continue to have low interest rates
and the rest of the world will buy treasury bonds.

168
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:36,380
We can maintain a lifestyle of convenience.

169
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:44,100
The illusion that this will continue to work, allows us to
accept this behaviour and not try too hard to change it.

170
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:50,060
We're not in a panic. It's not an emergency.
It was in 2008, but that was "fixed." Don't worry.

171
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:58,100
It will not happen again in 2019, and it won't be three
times bigger because we didn't actually fix anything.

172
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:02,320
The same symptoms still exist, but don't worry.

173
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:11,280
While you're not worrying, someone in Argentina is
worrying because their currency just crashed 45%.

174
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:17,780
They are experiencing that [this year] in an accelerated
fashion, in an environment where they can't simply...

175
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:22,280
outsource their debt to the rest of
the world in exchange for oil and war.

176
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:28,500
They suffer the consequence immediately. 
It is happening in Venezuela, in Brazil again.

177
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:34,720
It is happening in Turkey, in Ukraine,
and in dozens of other countries.

178
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:44,920
Until now, in all of these countries, when your
esteemed leader said your currency was crashing...

179
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:49,480
and your economy was dying, [they tried to claim
that it was not because of] systemic corruption...

180
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:55,580
throughout the entire system, or the parasitic behaviour
of hierarchies sucking off the middle class,

181
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:58,660
feasting on the carcass of the economy.

182
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:07,260
[They claimed it was] sabotage by the foreigners
next door, or some other external threat.

183
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:17,360
And not only is it your patriotic duty to use the currency,
but it is also your patriotic duty to not leave the country.

184
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:27,060
Of course, refugees do all the time, so apparently
they are not patriotic... There was no exit.

185
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:32,080
Until 2008, there wasn't really an alternative.

186
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:38,240
Holding U.S. dollars as a foreign currency, hoarding gold,
or putting it under your mattress, that is easy...

187
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:43,200
for a government to stop, to break down and censor.

188
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,700
They can confiscate your gold, raid your house.

189
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:55,680
If you are seen exchanging hard(er) currency, like
foreign currency, with others, you will get shot.

190
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:00,420
You won't just have a misdemeanor fine.

191
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:06,020
These countries can take entire populations
hostage on these hyerinflation orgies.

192
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:11,540
Then something happened in 2008: Bitcoin.

193
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:16,460
For the first time [in modern history], we had an option.

194
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:23,420
That option isn't just a separate currency.
It is a currency that can't be easy confiscated,

195
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,660
that can easily be transmitted across borders,

196
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:32,580
that can be used as a lifeboat [by people 
who can't physically exit the country].

197
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:38,880
They can exit the economy virtually, trading 
in another currency right where they are,

198
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:47,540
creating a parallel micro-economy in their community
which becomes connected to other little lifeboats.

199
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:57,080
[Life can] continue past the crisis. They don't have to
go down with the sinking boat of state to be patriotic.

200
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:05,760
That is happening today in Venezuela, in Argentina
and Turkey. Before that, in Cyprus and other places.

201
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,780
It is happening again and again, as people 
discover they have some other options.

202
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:17,980
Today, not many people can do that. It requires a level
of literacy, numeracy, and technological confidence...

203
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:20,340
that is not [yet present in] the masses.

204
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,160
But think about what happens in twenty years...

205
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:29,620
when some dictator decides to take an entire
economy hostage, and 25% of the population says,

206
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:34,960
"[Bye]! I'm taking my money out now."

207
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,680
Taking their money out isn't the act of investment
like we see here in the United States.

208
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:44,280
People say, "Let's invest in bitcoin," as if it is 
some kind of stock. "Let's buy low, sell high."

209
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:48,080
"Let's make lots of money, get rich quick!"

210
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:56,120
The act of exit is to say, "I will take my productive
capital, my labor, my services my products, and I will...

211
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:00,160
only make them available for this currency."

212
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:07,780
"I am simultaneously entering a new economy, trading
with other people who are with me, and I have exited."

213
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:15,640
I have withdrawn my participation, my collaboration,
with the system that is broken."

214
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:23,500
On that basis alone, this is a technology that [will]
change the world. But that's not what it's all about.

215
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:29,460
You hear this term... you would have heard it on this
video and you'll hear it again when you talk about...

216
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:33,180
cryptocurrencies, when you talk about
open blockchains with other people.

217
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:43,640
They will say, "decentralization." To most people,
that doesn't mean anything. It is a really vague word.

218
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:53,780
It doesn't have any impact in their lives.
Let's decipher what decentralization means.

219
00:22:53,780 --> 00:23:04,940
Decentralization means peer-to-peer, edge to edge,
end to end, and removing intermediaries.

220
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:12,400
It means reconnecting with each other so 
that we can have transactions, interactions.

221
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:18,500
Not just with money, but also with trust, 
corporate [governance], and other things...

222
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,500
that [could be] enabled through smart contracts.

223
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:26,920
We can do these things without intermediaries.
What is the role that intermediaries serve?

224
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:33,480
In most cases and markets, the fundamental
purpose of an intermediary is two-fold:

225
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:39,840
To provide a way for two parties (such as a buyer and
a seller) to engage in any kind of trusted transaction...

226
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,100
to find each other.

227
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:46,060
They create conditions where
people can find each other.

228
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:52,820
That is what Uber does. The drivers are out there;
you're out there. What is it we're doing?

229
00:23:52,820 --> 00:24:01,920
They are helping you found each other. That is a good
function, but we could also do that with [just] software.

230
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:06,660
Why exactly, in this day and age, do we 
need to create these double-ended markets...

231
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,500
where people need to find each other?

232
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:16,560
The other reason is trust. I can't trust the driver
unless there is some way of validating [their reliability],

233
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:19,100
[through] some kind of review or previous experience.

234
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:23,680
The driver can't trust that I [will] actually pay them.

235
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:35,840
Trust, until 2009, was a function that could only be done
by intermediaries acting in a hierarchy of oversight.

236
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:43,300
"I trust this intermediary because [it is] overseen by
another intermediary, who is overseen by another..."

237
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:50,100
The theory goes, eventually overseen by someone
who is a representative, in some elected body,

238
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:54,660
where I have some influence [within]
the consent of the governed.

239
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:57,060
The intermediary works for me,

240
00:24:57,060 --> 00:25:02,100
through my representatives, and are 
trusted because they have oversight.

241
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,880
In practice, that is not what happens.

242
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:11,940
In practice, the intermediary gets powerful enough to
start buying the intermediaries around and above them.

243
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:17,140
They [become] bigger and bigger, start sucking
and extracting more rent out of the system,

244
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:20,700
until eventually they buy the people doing the oversight.

245
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:26,780
Now the Congressman works for them,
and I am not a part of the system anymore.

246
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:33,860
It is no longer peer-to-peer. It is peer-
to-corporation-to-corporation-to-peer.

247
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:36,020
We're out.

248
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:38,340
Somebody asked me recently [after] a talk,

249
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:43,580
"If a homeless person on the street asks you
for a donation, how do you pay with bitcoin?"

250
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:50,420
"You can't pay them with bitcoin!"
Actually, I can and I have. I takes fifteen minutes.

251
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:55,700
I [must] teach them how to install a wallet, 
where to spend it, and how to find other people.

252
00:25:55,700 --> 00:26:03,920
It becomes an exercise of slightly patronizing
education, of course, but sometimes it is worth it.

253
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:10,320
I will also give them some cash
because I'm not a monster. [Laughter]

254
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:16,180
If you decide you [will] only tip or give money to
homeless people in bitcoin, you're a douchebag.

255
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:21,160
I mean, it's really quite simple... [Laughter]

256
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:25,420
[But] you can [give them bitcoin].
My question back to this person was,

257
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:30,380
"Tell me, how do you pay the
homeless person with a credit card?"

258
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:37,460
How many of you are carrying that much cash,
that you use for any purpose other than tipping?

259
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:45,620
We don't. We have outsourced our commerce through
these intermediaries. I have a simple question for you.

260
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:52,940
In this room tonight, how many of you have a point-of-
sale merchant system that can accept a credit card?

261
00:26:52,940 --> 00:27:05,280
I do. [AUDIENCE raises hands] Two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine out of 380 people.

262
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:10,660
[Almost] none of you can take my credit 
card, none of you can take a payment.

263
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:16,080
You can use intermediaries. You will need to stack them
all together and make a little pyramid of intermediaries.

264
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:22,120
I can put PayPal here, PayPal will take it from Visa,
Visa will take it from your Chase bank account...

265
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:31,720
So [the payment goes through] Chase, Visa, PayPal,
Chase, to me. Wait, how did Chase get in there twice?

266
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:39,420
[Laughter] Fuck! I should be in that business.
They didn't actually do anything. What do they do?

267
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:42,100
They moved some bits on the internet!

268
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:46,060
We have been moving bits on the internet 
for twenty-five years, [practically] for free!

269
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:57,900
How did they figure out that this costs
2% of my transaction? [Applause]

270
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:03,000
The invention of Bitcoin is about decentralization.
It removes intermediaries.

271
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:10,860
If you understand anything about the internet, all the
great things the internet did come down to one word:

272
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:14,260
disintermediation.

273
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:18,620
I need to put a classified ad in a newspaper 
to sell my furniture to my neighbor?

274
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:21,980
Oh no, I don't. Bye-bye, newspapers.

275
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:31,820
Oops, they're gone! An industry that existed for hundreds
of years, now a hollow shell that does info-tainment.

276
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:39,120
Several other industries have gradually fallen
to this powerful effect of disintermediation.

277
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:45,280
Disintermediation is important because it allows you
to do two things: shorten the distance between buyers...

278
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:49,340
and sellers, and remove all the
points of friction or control.

279
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:56,900
It means lower costs, faster service, a more
direct interaction between the service provider...

280
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,740
and the person consuming it.

281
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:04,060
We can start behaving like human beings 
that interact with each other.

282
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:12,420
if I buy from someone directly, I know who they are.
I don't need three intermediaries of trust in between.

283
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:15,060
Disintermediation remove these.

284
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:19,640
The other insidious problem of intermediaries is control.

285
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:23,160
They [will not] just take a cut of
everything they [are involved with].

286
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:30,920
They will start telling you what you can and
cannot sell, to whom you can and cannot sell,

287
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:35,100
in which country you can and cannot send money.

288
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:42,660
That [might be okay] if they shared
my moral principles and decided,

289
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:49,960
'No, we shouldn't be sending 40% of our budget to
Lockheed Martin and General fucking Dynamics...

290
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:53,680
to bomb people around the world.
Maybe we should do something else.'

291
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:59,900
[Applause] But no, they don't have my moral principles,
or probably your moral principles [either].

292
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:03,520
They think it's very wrong to send money to WikiLeaks,

293
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:08,240
which hasn't been convicted
of doing anything wrong - ever!

294
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:14,160
But it's perfectly all right to send a contribution
to the Alabama chapter of the KKK...

295
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:22,540
The fundamental problem in all of our platforms today is
that they have become gatekeepers as intermediaries.

296
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:30,580
The side effect is not just the 2% cost of every
transaction; it is the erosion of democracy.

297
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:37,140
It is the destruction of all other institutions 
we used to have control over.

298
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:47,240
We no longer have choice, we no longer have voice.
What is left when you have no choice, no voice? Exit.

299
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:56,900
We can exit the hard way, try to get fifty people into a tiny
boat and across the Mediterranean, a man-made crisis.

300
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:05,980
But exit the slightly less hard way, is saying "I'm opting
out. I am leaving your centralised, parasitical system."

301
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:16,180
"I am choosing to use decentralized 
platforms for my money, my payments."

302
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:31,260
"Perhaps, in the future, for my speech, my publishing, my
corporate organisation, and other trusted interactions."

303
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:39,100
Trust used to be a function of hierarchy.
It no longer is. Trust is now a protocol.

304
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:48,640
When we have the technological tools to convert
trusted institutions into a peer-to-peer protocol...

305
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:55,620
We take back that control. We remove
the intermediaries. We cut off the flows.

306
00:31:55,620 --> 00:32:02,540
If you want to stop a parasite, you [must] 
stop feeding it first. That is what this is about.

307
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:07,320
That is why decentralization matters.

308
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:18,700
When I talk to audiences in Argentina, Greece,
Cyprus, and other places around the world...

309
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:26,860
where they are not part of the 5% population
that has our advantages, they [understand].

310
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:30,700
They have already seen [the consequences],
two or three times in one generation.

311
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:40,560
They have seen what happens when money fails; when
institutions get corrupted, eroded, and finally destroyed,

312
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,460
by these parasitic organisations.

313
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:50,040
These parasitic organizations keep arising because
nothing has changed in the fundamental architecture.

314
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:54,800
If the architecture is a pyramid,
someone will climb to the top.

315
00:32:54,800 --> 00:33:03,440
Changing people at the top doesn't change 
the architecture. Corruption will flow upwards.

316
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,440
They are just 'doing their job.'

317
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,340
I have met plenty of bankers, [a lot of them] are
nice people just trying to pay their mortgages.

318
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:12,760
Most of them are debt slaves too.

319
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:20,740
They are contributing to the inexorable momentum
of a machine that only moves in one direction,

320
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:23,960
without guidance for morality,
because it doesn't have morals.

321
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:30,640
It's a corporation. It is not immoral, it is amoral.

322
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,700
"How do we increase our profit margin this week?"

323
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:38,720
"Well, we could sell facial recognition 
technology to law enforcement."

324
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,980
"After all what are they going to do with it?"

325
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:46,660
"Hey, didn't Oakland PD murder a whole bunch of their
own fucking citizens, even though they were unarmed?"

326
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:52,360
"Yes, but if they violate the Constitution, they will
probably be in violation of our Terms of Service."

327
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:56,740
"So we can shut them down."
Who the hell do you think you're kidding?

328
00:33:56,740 --> 00:34:03,460
Really? The people who make these decisions
are not evil people, they are moving inexorably.

329
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:12,920
They have seen this is a big pipe of money that
wants to throw millions or billions of dollars into...

330
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:20,620
facial recognition, surveillance, tasers, pepper spray,
drones that bomb you with pepper spray from the sky...

331
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:27,840
[Laughter] They think, 'Money!' They stick a straw in it. They are making decisions on a local context.

332
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:34,640
You cannot stop that by saying, "Be better, 
Amazon! Be better people." "Don't be evil!"

333
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:41,720
What a great slogan... You can't fix it.
We have to change the fundamental architecture.

334
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:50,260
The reason [these crimes] can be done by 
large corporations is because of centralisation.

335
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:59,780
They have taken the convenience of the one-click buy,
the profile share, and all the micro-violations of privacy.

336
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:04,780
They have built a massive information 
cartel that delivers billions of dollars,

337
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:10,560
that allows them to centralise and become parasites.

338
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:18,180
There are actually quite benevolent right now.
But we know where this is going. It [will] not get better.

339
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:25,100
It [will not] magically resolved our itself 
until we change the fundamental architecture.

340
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:30,120
That's the message of the 'Ulterior States' movie
we just watched, the message that Bitcoin brings.

341
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:33,440
The reason it is so strongly resisted [by 
those who run the current architecture]

342
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,820
is because it says,

343
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:37,660
"We don't need your permission."
"Your regulation isn't working."

344
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:41,080
"You can't scale to solve the problems of this planet."

345
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:46,860
"At a very fundamental level, your architecture is wrong."

346
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:53,520
The architecture we want is peer-to-peer, 
flat, decentralized, and end-to-end.

347
00:35:53,520 --> 00:36:01,920
Innovations are at the edges, without permission,
and are part of everyone's experience.

348
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,260
That's the architecture we want: peer-to-peer.

349
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:12,800
It matters in money, corporate
governance, law, and voting.

350
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:19,680
But first and most importantly,
we have to starve the parasites.

351
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:29,720
The first thing we need to break is the cartel of money.
We do that by exiting, by using peer-to-peer money.

352
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,660
Thank you. [Applause]
