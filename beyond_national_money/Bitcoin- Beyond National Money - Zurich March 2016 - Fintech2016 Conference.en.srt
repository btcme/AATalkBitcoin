1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:14,620
The topic of this conference is "fintech"
(financial technology), but Bitcoin is not "fintech."

2
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:21,140
That may surprise many of you. I hope, as you learn
more about Bitcoin, you will continue to be surprised.

3
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,440
I'll start [this talk] with what Bitcoin isn't.

4
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:31,840
Bitcoin isn't a company. Bitcoin isn't an application.
Bitcoin isn't "fintech." Bitcoin isn't banking.

5
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:37,380
Bitcoin is a protocol, an internet system.
It does not belong to any one company.

6
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:44,080
It doesn't belong to any one organization, 
just like the internet doesn't belong to any company.

7
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:51,780
It is a system for conducting transactions 
and commerce on a global basis,

8
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,400
[along with] many other trusted applications.

9
00:00:55,400 --> 00:01:07,260
Bitcoin isn't what you expect.
Bitcoin changes our expectations of what money is.

10
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:12,160
It changes the foundation of how
money and payment systems work.

11
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:18,860
This isn't just a little [disruption] that will affect
a few companies. This [will be] a [big disruption].

12
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:22,960
It will be as big as the internet,
perhaps in some ways even bigger.

13
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:31,980
It will not just affect finance. It will also affect politics
and governance. It will affect societies as a whole.

14
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:40,480
I'm a technical person, so I'm interested in how Bitcoin
works. After five years, I still discover new things...

15
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:44,220
and understanding it in even great depth.

16
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:49,260
Let me start with something
that happened two weeks ago.

17
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:55,700
Two weeks ago, president Barack Obama stood up
on stage at South by Southwest (SXSW) conference.

18
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:02,480
He talked about surveillance and said,
"If [law enforcement] can't unlock the phones,

19
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:09,200
that is if every person is carrying a
Swiss bank account in their pocket."

20
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:20,820
This [example] was supposed to provide a view
of a terrifying future where everyone has privacy.

21
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:26,100
Now, I'm sure some people in this room 
might think that is not such a bad idea...

22
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:30,560
for everybody to have a Swiss bank 
account in their pocket.  [Laughter]

23
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,040
You see, [the American] president was wrong.

24
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:41,580
There won't be a future in which everyone 
has a Swiss bank account in their pocket.

25
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:50,740
[It is a] present [and future] in which everyone
can have an entire Swiss bank in their pocket.

26
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:57,320
I have a system in my back pocket that
can generate two billion "account numbers,"

27
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:02,720
and wire money anywhere in the world
[in minutes or even seconds].

28
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:09,540
It can be the point of origination for loans and mortgages, for international finance and trade.

29
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,180
[It can be used for] import-export business, 
or for a remittance business.

30
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:21,220
I can build novel financial applications and
trading instruments, install them on my phone,

31
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:27,460
I have mobile banking, not as
a customer, but as a banker.

32
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:34,460
Even if you unlock my phone, my "Swiss bank
account in my pocket" [could still be] secure.

33
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:43,380
The terrifying future of privacy that president
Obama sees is actually already part of our present.

34
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:46,480
On January 3rd 2009, the world changed.

35
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,340
Few people noticed that [someone had] 
invented a system of money that allows...

36
00:03:50,340 --> 00:04:03,380
everyone in the world to have financial 
privacy, security, and [powerful] capabilities.

37
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:09,460
That will have important implications 
throughout [the rest of our] history.

38
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:16,520
People [often] ask me, "Will Bitcoin one day become the
currency of a country? Will it be adopted by the banks?"

39
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:22,620
To ask that question is to miss the point.
Bitcoin is not a national currency.

40
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:27,060
Bitcoin is now the de facto currency of the internet.

41
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:32,640
We have already seen more than a 
thousand other similar [cryptocurrencies].

42
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:39,500
[Bitcoin] is not just a new system of [payments],
but a network-centric system of money.

43
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:47,380
The major change with Bitcoin is not simply
that we can 'email' money across the world,

44
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:53,140
but that we can change the organizational 
structure behind money from hierarchical...

45
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:56,500
to a flat, network-centric model.

46
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:04,480
This is the same type of model that changed
centralized publishing and [media] broadcasting...

47
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:09,180
into a [more distributed], networked 
communication system of the internet.

48
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:19,560
It brought us social media; now we will have social
banking one day, a system that is person-to-person.

49
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:30,040
[There is a] need for disintermediation. 
There will be [less] need for financial intermediaries.

50
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:38,900
The role of intermediaries in most transactions
is not necessary when you can transact directly.

51
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:47,720
That doesn't mean people who use bitcoin won't have
intermediaries, but they don't [need them like today].

52
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:54,400
They can choose to add a third-party into 
their transactions, or they can choose not to.

53
00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:00,580
This is the choice that [becomes available] 
when you have this new currency of the internet.

54
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:04,560
It brings with it so many implications.

55
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:14,180
On my flight into ZÃ¼rich, I flew with Swissair, 
in an aircraft with a flag painted on its tail.

56
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:21,260
What an anachronism that is. Swissair is owned
by Lufthansa. It is no longer a national carrier.

57
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:28,480
But I remember a time when every aircraft had a flag
on its tail, when every airline was a national airline...

58
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:33,920
that had exclusive and monopoly access
to the skies and airports of [their] countries.

59
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:40,120
I remember a time when phone companies 
had flags and belonged exclusively to countries.

60
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,980
Those anachronisms are gone.

61
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:53,300
The idea that, in a few decades, money will still have
a flag or queen on it, and belong to a single nation,

62
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,480
will also seem like a silly anachronism.

63
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:01,020
It won't go away completely, of course. 
There will still be national money.

64
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:11,560
But there will also be hundreds, possibly thousands
of [cryptocurrencies] that have no flag, no allegiance...

65
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,000
to any country.

66
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,660
More importantly, money that is neutral to geopolitics.

67
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:24,460
There is enormous power in a system
of money that is neutral to geopolitics;

68
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:32,020
a system of money that [is regulated by] mathematical
functions which can be inspected by everyone,

69
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:41,480
and doesn't change its nature according to the
latest alliances or hostilities between nations.

70
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:47,540
A money that remains a stable and
neutral backdrop to global trade.

71
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:52,640
A money of the internet,
for the internet, and by the internet.

72
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:57,140
That can sound quite terrifying, honestly.

73
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:05,300
If you're terrified, you are probably also worried about
how the internet [enabled] free expression for everyone.

74
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:12,700
But I can tell you, there is a generation growing up
right now who, when they hear of a money that is...

75
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:21,960
of the internet, for the internet, and by the internet,
think it is a natural [progression] and how it should be.

76
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:29,160
The internet has been giving them freedom 
[of expression] for as long as they remember.

77
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:40,060
By the time the next generation reaches the age of 16
and finally acquires the right to open a bank account.,

78
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:48,140
they may have been using digital, network-centric
currencies like bitcoin already for a decade.

79
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:55,540
Two-year-olds, six-year-olds can open a 
Bitcoin [wallet]. You don't open an account.

80
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,440
You can download an app.

81
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:03,020
After a decade of using digital money on the
internet that is near instantaneous and global,

82
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,680
when happens [when those kids] go
and open [their] first bank account?

83
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:13,380
[They] have a conversation [with a teller], who explains
why the system only operates from Monday to Friday.

84
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:21,760
Why does it take three to five business days
to execute an international transaction?

85
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:31,360
Given that they have loaned money to the bank,
why will they be charged five Swiss francs a month...

86
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,940
for the privilege of [having a bank
account that earns] no interest?

87
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,100
[In the future], when you explain [banks] to a 16-year-old,

88
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:45,640
they will look at you as if you have just 
asked them to send the fax. [Laughter]

89
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:49,940
The world has changed, but this
is not something to be afraid of.

90
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:52,720
This is a tremendous opportunity.

91
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,040
There are 2.5 billion people in the world 
who have no economic access to banking,

92
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,520
according to The World Bank,
which is a very conservative estimate.

93
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,460
They only count the heads of household...

94
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:08,640
and the circumstances in which
no banking is available whatsoever,

95
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,620
those who are entirely in cash-based societies.

96
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:18,540
That is a very conservative [way] to estimate it.
I look at it from a different perspective.

97
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:25,020
I belong to a privileged elite who can open an online
brokerage account within twenty-four hours.

98
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:31,560
Tomorrow morning, I can be trading
in yen on the Tokyo stock exchange.

99
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:39,500
I can wire money anywhere in the world, in any currency
I want. I have the full capability of international, liquid,

100
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:43,440
multi-currency banking with no currency controls.

101
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,320
How many people have that? Maybe 1.5 billion people.

102
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:55,780
Then there is the other six billion, many of them
completely unbanked, most of them under-banked.

103
00:10:55,780 --> 00:11:02,460
From a technological perspective, giving them
economic inclusion is now within our reach.

104
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:12,780
But we lack the political [will] to do that.
We have decided that it is more important...

105
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:20,700
to live in a world where every financial transaction, [from
anywhere and from anyone], should be fully identified.

106
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:25,440
We have created a system where
[we as] individuals have no privacy,

107
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,380
where every financial transaction
is subject to total surveillance,

108
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:32,680
and you must identify yourself in order to transact.

109
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:36,360
This [kind of system] has never existed in history before.

110
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:44,560
The fundamental advantage of cash is that you don't
need to do a credit check when you exchange it.

111
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:54,080
If you give me ten Swiss francs, the money itself is the
bearer of value. It is independent of your credit [score],

112
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,600
or your identity.

113
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:01,000
I do not care, nor do I want to know, who you are.
I can simply transact [peer-to-peer with you].

114
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,340
That is a very fundamental [advantage which]
allows everyone to participate in the economy.

115
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:10,080
[But politicians and some corporations] are 
trying to change that, where every endpoint...

116
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:14,200
is controlled and identity is part
of every financial transaction.

117
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:22,160
That is not a good future. That is a future 
which worsens economic access and equality.

118
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:28,560
That is a future in which people are no longer just cut
off because they don't have sufficient documentation.

119
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:35,220
[They use it to] cut off entire countries. In the era
of the internet, economic inclusion is declining.

120
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:43,960
But bitcoin brings a new model of digital cash,
where identity is irrelevant and unnecessary,

121
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,860
where privacy is the default.

122
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:52,400
In that model, security [is incentivised]
by the network-centric money.

123
00:12:52,400 --> 00:13:02,240
The instrument itself bears value. It is unassailable,
unforgeable, and doesn't require identity.

124
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:07,000
With that, we will break down the
biggest barrier to economic inclusion.

125
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:14,860
A simple text-messaging feature phone in the middle of
a village in sub-Saharan Africa, connected to a solar cell,

126
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:18,780
will have the same capabilities as a Swiss bank.

127
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:25,680
[It could] be an originating point or a destination point
for international wire transfers, remittances, credit,

128
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:38,240
with a bearer instrument of value that is cash, in an
electronic medium, without any concern for identity.

129
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:47,180
That is the vision I have. To me, it is very important
to re-discover the value of individual privacy.

130
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:54,440
Individual privacy is economic inclusion. 
That is how we have always operated as a society.

131
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:59,580
The dream, [or rather nightmare], of creating a
completely controlled and closed system of finance,

132
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:04,240
where everything is under surveillance, 
started in the 1970s.

133
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:11,060
[That dream] died on January 3rd 2009 with the
invention of Bitcoin. It will never happen now.

134
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:18,280
Now, every person in the world has
the option to trade in digital cash.

135
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:27,460
We will not bank the other six billion,
but rather we will de-bank all of us.

136
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:34,140
Banking is now an app. That doesn't mean 
that there will be no room for banks in this.

137
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:42,840
Quite the contrary in fact, [there will still be a need]
to coordinate lending, to deliver security services,

138
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,560
and offering other financial services
[may] become even greater.

139
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:55,300
The opportunity is to encompass the other six billion
into this new world of application-based banking,

140
00:14:55,300 --> 00:15:01,580
to create a world in which borders are meaningless,
just like they [often] are on the internet.

141
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:08,520
This will require some very brave bankers. 
You must go against an edifice of borders,

142
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:16,940
built over the last fifty to seventy years, which have
segmented the world into isolated islands of finance...

143
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,960
that cannot connect to each other.

144
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,400
The promise at the end of [the road] is this:

145
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:29,220
billions of new people, new customers who
now have access to a global financial system.

146
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:38,120
The era of currencies with flags is as 
obsolete as the era of airlines with flags.

147
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:45,500
We must not fear this. We must welcome the fact that
this has now happened. It cannot be turned back.

148
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:49,620
It cannot be stopped. It is already happening.

149
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:53,740
Those who embrace it will have the 
opportunity to enter this new world...

150
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:58,100
and create financial opportunity for many.

151
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:06,440
There is a difference between banking as it is executed
in America, and banking as a culture in this country.

152
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:11,460
I am very hopeful that I can bring this 
message here [and you will understand].

153
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:17,660
In America, investment banking is where your banker
smiles to your face while helping you through an IPO,

154
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:24,380
yet is front-running transactions behind 
your back and picking your pocket. [Laughter]

155
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:27,680
That is the truth.

156
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:36,360
[In contrast], Switzerland has a centuries-old tradition
of banking as a multi-generational relationship of trust.

157
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:43,020
A relationship that is as sacred as a relationship
with your doctor, your lawyer, or even your priest.

158
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:53,460
It is a relationship that aims to give individual power,
wealth control, and privacy to every customer.

159
00:16:53,460 --> 00:17:02,980
If you really believe in that culture, if you really feel
the ethos of banking is that service to your customers,

160
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:09,460
then perhaps you can see that bitcoin is simply
a new means of delivering that relationship.

161
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:16,960
These new network-centric digital currencies
[can] deliver unassailable privacy and security.

162
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:27,160
They are a way to re-establish that ethos
of private banking, but not just for the few.

163
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,020
For everyone.

164
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:37,480
That is what I hope you will see in this new
post-national, international, network-centric money.

165
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:48,080
The money of the internet. Thank you. [Applause]
