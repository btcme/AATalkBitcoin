1
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,680
[SAM DASTYARI] Open the second hearing of the Senate
Economics References Committee into digital currency.

2
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:22,120
The Senate referred this inquiry to the Committee
on 2 October 2014, for report by 2 March 2015.

3
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:27,040
On 2 March 2015, the Senate granted
an extension to report by 10 August 2015.

4
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,600
The Committee has received forty-six submissions,
which are available on the Committee's website.

5
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,900
I would like to take this opportunity to thank
those who made submissions to the inquiry,

6
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,600
and the witnesses who have taken time
to appear before the committee today,

7
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,920
and at the previous public
hearing on 26 November 2014.

8
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,780
These are public proceedings, although
the committee may determine or agree to...

9
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,600
a request that evidence be heard in camera.

10
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,580
I ask everyone to ensure that they have switched off,
or turned to silent [mode], their mobile phones.

11
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,940
I would ask photographers and cameramen to
follow the instructions of the Committee Secretary...

12
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:56,420
and ensure that senators' and witnesses' 
laptops and personal papers are not filmed.

13
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:57,660
I remind all witnesses that,

14
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,820
in giving evidence to the Committee, they 
are protected by parliamentary privilege.

15
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:05,640
It is unlawful for anyone to threaten or disadvantage
a witness on account of evidence given to a committee,

16
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,400
and such actions may be treated
by the Senate as contempt.

17
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,300
If a witness objects to answering a question,

18
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,140
the witness should state the ground 
upon which the objection is taken.

19
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,080
The Committee will determine whether
it will insist on an answer, having regard to...

20
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,740
the ground on which it was claimed.

21
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,420
If the Committee determines to insist on an answer,

22
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,720
a witness may request that
the answer is given in camera.

23
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,440
Such a request may of course
be made at any other time.

24
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,700
A witness called to answer a question for the first time...

25
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,220
should state their full name and
the capacity in which they appear.

26
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,420
I now welcome Mr. [Andreas] Antonopoulos.

27
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:35,740
For the record, could you state your full name
and the capacity in which you appear?

28
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:38,700
[ANDREAS] Hello, my name
is Andreas M. Antonopoulos.

29
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,780
I am an author and computer security expert.

30
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,000
[SAM DASTYARI] Thank you so much, and thank you
for taking the extra effort to participate in our inquiry.

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,600
I want to invite you to make a few brief opening remarks,
and then I think we have a few questions for you.

32
00:01:52,600 --> 00:02:00,060
[ANDREAS] Thank you.
Thank you, Chair and Committee members.

33
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,940
I appreciate this opportunity to contribute 
to these proceedings about digital currency.

34
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:08,840
My [professional] experience is primarily in 
information security and network architecture.

35
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:14,220
I have a master's degree in networks and distributed
systems, and have worked in this field since 1992.

36
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:19,320
I spent twenty years working on networks and
data centers for financial services companies...

37
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,780
before I found Bitcoin in late 2011.

38
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:26,460
I have been working full-time in the
Bitcoin space for the past two years,

39
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:30,940
and written a book for software developers
with the title "Mastering Bitcoin."

40
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:36,460
Bitcoin's unique architecture and payment mechanism
has important implications for network access,

41
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:41,640
innovation, privacy, individual empowerment,
consumer protection, and regulation.

42
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,600
I welcome the opportunity to talk
to you about these issues today.

43
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,840
For Australia, Bitcoin represents
a unique opportunity in two areas:

44
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:55,080
firstly, Bitcoin can introduce much-needed 
competition in the retail payments industry,

45
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,900
undercutting the expensive systems 
offered by credit and debit cards,

46
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,740
while significantly improving
security and privacy for consumers;

47
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:09,260
secondly, the Bitcoin industry can establish Australia
on the forefront of the next wave of innovation...

48
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:14,560
that can extend financial services to more than
two billion people throughout Southeast Asia...

49
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,360
who are currently underbanked.

50
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,760
Just like cellular telephones allowed billions
[of people] to become connected with the world,

51
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:25,680
entirely bypassing the need for fixed-line telephone
infrastructure, Bitcoin can do the same for banking.

52
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,860
Australia is already the home
of a thriving Bitcoin industry,

53
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:32,220
which can become a leader in the region and the world.

54
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:38,820
Until the invention of Bitcoin in 2008, security and
decentralization seemed like [opposing] concepts.

55
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:45,640
Traditional models for financial payment networks and
banking rely on centralized control to provide security.

56
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,800
The architecture is built around central 
authorities such as a clearinghouse.

57
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:55,340
Those within the center of the network are vested
with enormous power, act with full authority;

58
00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:01,160
therefore, they must be very carefully vetted,
regulated, and subject to oversight.

59
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:07,040
Bitcoin is fundamentally different. The security
model of blockchain currencies is decentralized.

60
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:13,220
There is no centre to the network, no central authority,
no concentration of power, and no actor in whom...

61
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,320
complete trust must be vested.

62
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:21,180
In Bitcoin, security is an emergent property of the
collaboration of thousands of network participants,

63
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,880
not a function of a single authority.

64
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:30,280
If a bad actor infiltrates a traditional financial network,
the network itself and all its participants are at risk.

65
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:36,740
In contrast, if a bad actor has accessed the Bitcoin
network, they have no power over the network itself.

66
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:39,280
They do not compromise trust in the network.

67
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,760
Therefore, the Bitcoin network can be
open to any participant without vetting,

68
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:48,700
authentication, identification, or prior authorization.

69
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:54,000
This freedom of access creates freedom to innovate
without permission from the incumbents,

70
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,280
the same fundamental force that has driven
innovation on the internet for twenty years,

71
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:02,280
creating enormous value for all.

72
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,000
Centralized financial networks can
never be fully open to innovation...

73
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,780
because their security depends on access control.

74
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:15,760
Incumbents in such networks effectively utilize access
control to stifle outside innovation and competition,

75
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:21,080
falsely presenting their anti-competitive 
actions as consumer protection.

76
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:25,920
Bitcoin's decentralized nature affords consumer
protection in the most powerful and direct way,

77
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:31,120
by allowing bitcoin users direct control over 
the privacy of their financial transactions.

78
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,160
Bitcoin transactions never expose 
vulnerable account identifiers.

79
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,560
Bitcoin users can protect the privacy
of their transactions without relying on,

80
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,900
or trusting any intermediaries.

81
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:47,160
Contrary to popular misconception,
Bitcoin is not unregulated.

82
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,040
Rather, several aspects of the
Bitcoin network and financial system...

83
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,720
are regulated by mathematical algorithms.

84
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:59,360
The algorithmic regulation in Bitcoin offers 
predictable, objective, measurable outcomes.

85
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,240
Algorithmic regulation provides certainty 
without nationalistic or geopolitical influence.

86
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:10,760
In a time of unprecedented currency wars, 
mathematical neutrality is a safe haven.

87
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:15,680
In trying to understand consumer protection,
[roles for] oversight, audit, and regulation of Bitcoin,

88
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:21,320
there is a risk that many will try to apply familiar models
of the past to this new digital currency system.

89
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:27,880
I urge you to resist the temptation to apply 
centralized solutions to this decentralized network.

90
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:34,280
Centralizing Bitcoin [would] weaken its security, dull its
innovative potential, and remove its most disruptive...

91
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,880
yet also most promising features.

92
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,480
Centralization will disempower users
while empowering incumbents.

93
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:47,760
Consumer protection will not be achieved by
removing Bitcoin's built-in privacy characteristics.

94
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:52,060
We cannot protect consumers by removing 
their ability to control their own privacy,

95
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:57,600
then asking them to entrust it in the same intermediaries
who have failed them so many times before.

96
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:04,300
In this new decentralized financial network, we have
the opportunity to invent new security mechanisms...

97
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:10,080
based upon innovations such as multi-signature
escrow, smart contracts, hardware wallets,

98
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,500
decentralized audits, and algorithmic proof of reserves.

99
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:18,520
These are the new decentralized regulatory 
and security tools that are most appropriate...

100
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,880
for a decentralized digital currency.

101
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,120
Thank you for the opportunity
to address this committee.

102
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,640
[SAM DASTYARI] Thank you so much
for that fantastic opening statement.

103
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:33,880
I have a few questions. Before I get to them,
I think Senator Canavan had a few. Senator Canavan?

104
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:39,500
[MATTHEW CANAVAN] Thank you, Chair. I want to
thank Mr. Antonopoulos for making yourself available.

105
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:45,000
We were recently in Canada and I know you 
have given evidence to their Senate Committee.

106
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,880
They mentioned you as somebody who was one
of the most impressive witnesses they have had.

107
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:57,320
It is fantastic that you have been able to join us as well.
I really want to drill down on your last comment there,

108
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:05,400
about avoiding imposing old-school regulatory models,
so to speak, on a newly emerging technology.

109
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,940
How do we draw the line? I have noticed in 
some of the other comments you have made...

110
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:15,780
that there is a distinction between the use of
bitcoin between individuals on a personal basis,

111
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:23,000
and perhaps some of the infrastructure that might
grow around Bitcoin, including custodial accounts...

112
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,220
[and other] banking-type services.

113
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:31,420
Do you still see that there is some regulation needed
for Bitcoin companies that might provide more...

114
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,560
than just access to currency?

115
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:39,540
[ANDREAS] Thank you, Senator. Custodial accounts,
as you mentioned, are of particular concern.

116
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:45,900
In fact, any accounts that take control of 
[many] bitcoin keys remove them from...

117
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:53,020
the protection [of the] security [model] of a 
[decentralized] network, create areas of centralization.

118
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:59,120
We have seen before, many times, that such
environments are prone to hacking, theft,

119
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,740
and [even] cases [where] we suspect there 
to have been embezzlement and insider action.

120
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:09,320
Those types of organizations with 
custodial access have all the problems...

121
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,940
of traditional, centralized financial networks.

122
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:16,200
In short, if you give someone your money, 
they will [try to] run away with it.

123
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:21,400
The need for regulation, oversight, audits,

124
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:25,840
and all the traditional financial controls 
imposed in those situations, is paramount.

125
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:31,340
The key is to recognize the fundamental difference
between custodial [and non-custodial] accounts...

126
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:37,800
in decentralized access and control over 
finance that Bitcoin offers in its model.

127
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,380
[MATTHEW CANAVAN] So, say in your situation..

128
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,140
I presume you are more familiar
with Canada than [Australia].

129
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:50,380
In Canada, would you think it is possible to 
apply the prudential consumer protection laws...

130
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:58,300
that exist for traditional banks to Bitcoin and digital
currency-type banks, without major modification?

131
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:05,140
Could they be brought into your financial regulatory
space quite easily? And treated just like they are-

132
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:15,400
You know, they must have reserves against liabilities and
deposits, provide consumers with product disclosure...

133
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,460
and all those aspects.

134
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:19,720
Could that happen? Could we do that easily?

135
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,740
[ANDREAS] I am more familiar with the 
regulatory framework in the United States.

136
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,660
[MATTHEW CANAVAN] Yes, that's fine. Okay.

137
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:32,300
I would say that many of the existing regulations
[there] apply quite comfortably to Bitcoin.

138
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:37,200
[Custodial accounts] can be treated similarly
to any foreign currency [in a] brokerage account,

139
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:43,780
with all the requirements which come from the
use of that type of instrument and account system.

140
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:49,140
However, there are some unique [operations]
that can be done in the Bitcoin space...

141
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:52,120
that can't be done in traditional financial environments.

142
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,620
I think there is an opportunity to
take advantage of those [niches].

143
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:01,280
For example, in a traditional financial institution, internal
audits and third-party audits must be used in order to...

144
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,840
prove reserve adequacy.

145
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:12,980
That is subject to manipulation and can be 
falsified if the auditors are not eagle-eyed.

146
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:16,860
We have seen several scandals,
especially in the United States,

147
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:20,400
where auditors were complicit
with financial shenanigans,

148
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,820
leading to falsified audit accounts.

149
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:31,820
In Bitcoin, mathematical proofs of reserve can be
created whereby the reserve accounts of bitcoin...

150
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:35,820
[attributed to] each and every participant 
who has a custodial account on the service..

151
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:43,920
can be added up and the result verified independently
by each customer, without revealing anyone's balance.

152
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:52,420
There are some unique cryptographic solutions that are
innovative and would allow for much more flexibility.

153
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:58,780
[MATTHEW CANAVAN] At the moment in 
the United States, do you see companies...

154
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:02,940
offering fractional reserve banking for bitcoin?

155
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,960
[ANDREAS] I hope not.

156
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:12,160
I believe that most of the [services] we see 
in the United States are not fractional reserve.

157
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:21,400
They are full-reserve situations. In Bitcoin, there is a very
high risk with [running] fractional reserve arrangements.

158
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:26,720
Because of the fixed nature of the currency, 
the [price] volatility and exchange rate risk,

159
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,140
such a scheme would be very dangerous.

160
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:36,460
The problem is whether these organizations
can prove that they have full reserves or not.

161
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:41,580
That is a question still not answered 
to the satisfaction of most consumers.

162
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:47,360
The other thing to note, very briefly,
is the potential existence of hybrid models.

163
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:53,860
[These would be] accounts which appear 
on the surface to be custodial, but where...

164
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:56,660
the exchange, bank, or financial institution...

165
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:02,140
only has control over a minority of
the keys in a multi-signature [setup].

166
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:07,000
[For example], a financial institution
that has one key out of three keys...

167
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,440
can [partially] authorize a transaction and 
sign for it, but cannot [fully] do so on their own.

168
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,260
They [would] need a second signature from another key.

169
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:23,740
Those hybrid environments require special 
consideration, because they offer the flexibility...

170
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:28,500
of managed banking and financial services 
without the risks of custodial control.

171
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,540
Quite simply, the bank can't run away with the money.

172
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:37,300
[MATTHEW CANAVAN] My final question on
this topic: in the North American Bitcoin industry,

173
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:46,980
are they calling for, or do they want to have, 
your financial regulators [exercise] oversight on them?

174
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:52,020
Do they want that third-party
assurance from the government?

175
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:59,200
I forgot the name of your commission
there in America... Sorry? The SEC.

176
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:04,560
Do they want the SEC to come and give them
a stamp of approval, so they can go to market?

177
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,420
[ANDREAS] Some companies are asking for regulation
and oversight in order to provide [some] certainty.

178
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:16,860
However, in the United States, one of the reasons
this is such a challenging environment to operate in,

179
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:21,080
is the overlap between federal,
state, and local regulations.

180
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:25,740
Money transmitter licenses are regulated at 
the state level, which exposes companies to...

181
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:29,880
fifty different licensing requirements in fifty states.

182
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:38,300
Between the SEC, Financial Crime Enforcement Network
(FinCEN), the Departments of Justice and the Treasury,

183
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:43,640
state regulators, banking institutions, 
FINRA, and various other organizations,

184
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:49,400
there are probably two dozen different regulators,
all jumping in and trying to regulate [this industry],

185
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,640
[while] not understanding Bitcoin.

186
00:14:51,640 --> 00:15:00,820
At the moment, one of the big problems [in the United
States] is fragmentation and overlapping of jurisdiction.

187
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:12,120
That is why jurisdictions that can offer more clarity
in regulator affairs, less of a quilted environment,

188
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,340
will actually have an advantage over the United States.

189
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:20,780
[MATTHEW CANAVAN] If I can just ask one follow-up:
do you think Australia has that potential advantage?

190
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,860
[ANDREAS] I would have said 'yes' several months ago.

191
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:29,680
However, I believe that a recent decision applied
a sales tax to every bitcoin purchase or sale,

192
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:36,580
which I think fundamentally misunderstands the nature
of the system and ascribes properties of a commodity,

193
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,760
which [bitcoin is not.

194
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:44,720
As a result, that adds significant friction and may be a
major disadvantage for Australian Bitcoin companies.

195
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,400
[MATTHEW CANAVAN] I will leave it there, 
Chair, in light of my follow-up. I will hand back.

196
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:54,040
[SAM DASTYARI] Yes. Mr. Antonopoulos, 
so far as we have conducted these hearings-

197
00:15:54,040 --> 00:16:01,380
We had a group of people from the industry come
speak to us about potential opportunities and growth.

198
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:12,460
After we hear from you, we will have the Australian
security agencies [come in], our equivalent of the FBI,

199
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:17,820
[consisting of] the Australian federal police,
attorney general's department, and crime commission.

200
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:26,180
They seem to regularly cite an FBI
report that I think was done in 2011,

201
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:30,860
regarding security concerns about Bitcoin.

202
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:39,360
Before they come in, I wouldn't mind having 
your take on those kinds of security concerns.

203
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:45,400
Obviously they will come in and present the 
view of the security risks associated with it.

204
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:49,520
I wouldn't mind getting your take on that.
I know it is not the area you have specialized in,

205
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:54,000
but I wouldn't mind picking your brain about
how legitimate some of those concerns are,

206
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,800
and how much of them are overblown?

207
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,080
[ANDREAS] Could you be more specific 
about which security concerns you refer to?

208
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:03,180
I am not sure if I am familiar with a specific FBI report.

209
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:08,280
[SAM DASTYARI] Largely, the concern expressed-

210
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,960
I am paraphrasing the words of others 
from the security agencies here.

211
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:18,280
Effectively, [the concern is] that this is something which
will be used for dark and horrible things on the internet,

212
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:22,480
drug trafficking and terrorism financing.

213
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:27,760
That the lack of controls that they have,
as opposed to other currency exchanges,

214
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:33,080
means that there are greater risks 
associated with it than other matters.

215
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:39,360
As a result, I think there is a hesitation from the
security agencies, about creating a framework...

216
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,540
where this industry can grow.

217
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:47,920
[ANDREAS] Very good.
Well, that argument in my mind is false.

218
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:52,720
I will give a number of reasons why I believe it is false.
First of all, it is an argument we have heard before.

219
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,240
We have heard it extensively about the internet itself.

220
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:02,680
In the early '90s, the internet was seen as a 
den of pornographers, thieves, and terrorists.

221
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:07,160
There were all kinds of horrible stories 
about how the future would unfold.

222
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:12,980
The truth was, it gained adoption by reflecting
the desires and needs of mainstream society.

223
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:19,320
Most people are more interested in posting videos of
their cats than using it to communicate with terrorists.

224
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:29,100
The truth is, people will use bitcoin to feed their families,
send their kids to school, pay for healthcare, get payroll..

225
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:36,340
They will do so because, as it goes mainstream,
so do the use [cases] of this currency.

226
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,680
The currency itself is inherently neutral.

227
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:49,180
I think there is also a massive misconception about
Bitcoin being anonymous. Bitcoin is not anonymous.

228
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:55,800
What it doesn't offer is a totalitarian model of
financial surveillance where every transaction...

229
00:18:55,800 --> 00:19:00,060
can be tracked from origin to destination [and
attributed to identities] without due process,

230
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:06,100
without [suspicion of crime], treating everyone as
[potentially] guilty by engaging in financial transactions.

231
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:10,560
We have seen in specific prosecutions, 
especially here in the United States,

232
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:17,220
that when [reasonable] calls for concern or 
suspicion exist and due process is followed,

233
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:24,780
the Bitcoin ledger actually offers a forensically
accurate registry of every transaction that happens.

234
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:27,620
This has been used very effectively by law enforcement.

235
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:32,980
Traditional law enforcement practices, such as
using informants and constructing trails...

236
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:36,940
by collecting information through
due process and warrants,

237
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:39,820
are much more effective in the Bitcoin environment.

238
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:46,280
For example, for a transaction in the traditional financial
networks that involves a multi-party conspiracy,

239
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:50,840
in many cases that will [take the form of] 
wire transfers across multiple jurisdictions.

240
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,900
Collecting a forensically accurate trail of 
these [transfers] requires serving subpoenas...

241
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:59,540
in multiple jurisdictions, with the collaboration
of Interpol and related agencies.

242
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:04,340
In Bitcoin, just download the blockchain onto your laptop
and now you have a forensic trail of every transaction...

243
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,680
that has ever happened.

244
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:14,180
All you need is one thread to pull through due process,
to be able to link [those transactions] to an identity,

245
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:17,720
You will be able to see a full list of all transactions.

246
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:23,920
Law enforcement had no problem using those
techniques to deliver prosecutions in the United States,

247
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,460
using [the Bitcoin blockchain] as evidence.

248
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:30,240
I think these fears are very overrated.

249
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:37,220
When I speak to law enforcement agents, they think
that Bitcoin is a rather benign form of digital currency.

250
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:42,700
There are others that are much stealthier and anonymous, which may be encouraged to grow...

251
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:46,120
if onerous legislation is passed.

252
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:53,740
Certainly, bitcoin has been used
for criminal purposes. That is a fact.

253
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:57,200
But if I may use a slightly humorous analogy,

254
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,200
it has come to my attention that the
vast majority of criminals also use shoes.

255
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,700
That doesn't mean that shoes are the problem, right?

256
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:12,060
Bitcoin is money, which is a means to an end.
The end to which it is put, depends on who is using it.

257
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:17,660
As it becomes more mainstream, that use will
gradually change and become more benign.

258
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:23,280
It is natural that, in an environment where cash is used
for the majority of [lower level] criminal enterprise,

259
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:28,520
a form of digital cash which offers lower 
friction will be attractive to certain elements.

260
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:34,500
But if they make the mistake of thinking it is
anonymous, they will find out soon that it is not.

261
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:42,400
Bitcoin is resistant to totalitarian surveillance.
I think that is a good thing in a democratic society.

262
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:47,580
[MATTHEW CANAVAN] I'm just trying to square that.
You say it is resistant to totalitarian surveillance,

263
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:51,980
but you can download the entire
blockchain onto your laptop now.

264
00:21:51,980 --> 00:22:00,960
I don't understand all the cryptography behind this, but
presumably governments will employ smart people...

265
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:08,280
who could find a way to still surveil our transactions
if we were all using digital currencies.

266
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:13,760
Is that not a risk, given that they are all public?

267
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,980
[ANDREAS] Certainly the transactions can be surveilled,
but they cannot be [easily] attached to identities.

268
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:25,460
In most cases, in order to attach it to an identity,
you need to do [more], such as seizing equipment...

269
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:30,900
from the person(s) of interest, which would 
require the due-process action of a court.

270
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:37,160
It works pretty well in terms of the 
difference between secrecy and privacy.

271
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:41,800
Privacy as an individual right can be 
maintained, while secrecy overall cannot.

272
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:48,840
On Bitcoin, it is much easier to achieve radical
transparency than it is to achieve anonymity.

273
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:54,340
And Bitcoin cannot be seen
on its own without the context.

274
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:59,680
The context is, there are [hundreds] of other
digital currencies created in the last two years,

275
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,320
based on the recipe [of Bitcoin].

276
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:08,280
[Some are] more anonymous and stealthy
than Bitcoin, and will continue to thrive regardless...

277
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,080
of what regulation is placed on Bitcoin.

278
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:18,660
If anything, the risk with pushing Bitcoin into a corner
[will be] like [what happened] with the music industry.

279
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:26,500
where they pushed Napster into a corner and ended
up with much more [resistant] file-sharing networks.

280
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:31,620
[MATTHEW CANAVAN] Do you think-
If we decide that this is too risky,

281
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:38,240
that it creates too great a security threat, 
and we wanted to try and stamp it out...

282
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,800
We we can only pass laws for Australia.

283
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:47,660
How effective [could we be], even in coordination
with other countries, in stopping digital currency?

284
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:52,800
Where is it located right now? Presumably, it can
always go to a country where there aren't regulations.

285
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:58,180
Those who want to do wrong can still can still access it?

286
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:04,200
[ANDREAS] Honestly, Senator, Bitcoin and 
the decentralized innovation behind Bitcoin...

287
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:10,260
have turned money and transactional 
exchange into a form of information content.

288
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:14,980
You can no longer stop information
from flowing that carries bitcoin [with it]...

289
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,980
than you can stop information from flowing...

290
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:21,600
that carries a subversive tweet, as the 
president of Turkey realized recently,

291
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:28,580
or other forms of information flow in a free society
where the internet exists and can be accessed.

292
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,860
[Let alone other] forms of communication.

293
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:36,660
Bitcoin will continue to exist. As long as there are
network nodes that support its block propagation,

294
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,140
it will continue to exist.

295
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:47,340
Regulation of the protocol itself is not possible.

296
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:50,540
[SAM DASTYARI] Edwards, would you like to jump in?

297
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:53,220
[SEAN EDWARDS] If you [don't] want to 
continue with that line of questioning...

298
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:58,720
[MATTHEW CANAVAN] I am happy to ask 
one more question, slightly moving along...

299
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:06,920
from the law enforcement front to tax,
not necessarily nefarious or criminal activity.

300
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:12,500
I have seen you mention it. For example, Google
could use bitcoin to do payroll all around the world,

301
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,980
and save a lot on transaction costs.

302
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:21,120
Of course, Google has also been subject to a fair
amount of controversy about how they pay tax,

303
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,920
where they pay tax, and if they pay tax. [Laughter]

304
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:31,060
We have a related inquiry into corporate tax.
I don't know if you have any information on this,

305
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:35,000
but do you think digital currencies are another
order of difficulty for taxation authorities,

306
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:44,380
in terms of tracking transfers and pricing, and
related issues about the jurisdiction of profits?

307
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:52,880
[ANDREAS] I don't think so. When products and services
can be delivered from [almost] anywhere in the world,

308
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,260
and [many] payments can be
transferred [in different currencies],

309
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:58,760
there is no fundamental difference in using bitcoin.

310
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:05,660
From my experience, I think it is important to realize
that most tax [report] systems are based on honesty,

311
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:09,260
and then severe punishments if you
fail to meet that standard of honesty.

312
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:15,020
When I submit a tax return, my bank account
is not audited for every transaction I have made.

313
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:16,860
That is not how it works.

314
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:22,520
However, if I lie on my tax return and am caught,
then everything I have done will be audited,

315
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:27,780
including the transactions I made in bitcoin,
which are already available on a public ledger.

316
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:33,640
Again, it doesn't really change the basic social
contract between people and their government.

317
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:41,100
Most people report their taxes honestly and try to
[access] services from their government in return.

318
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:44,780
Their use of bitcoin will only increase their 
economic opportunity to [participate in]...

319
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:50,020
international trade and commerce with 
people from other parts of the world.

320
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:55,240
It doesn't really change the mechanics of taxation.

321
00:26:55,240 --> 00:27:03,260
It allows an individual to act more like a multi-national
company in terms of [transacting] internationally.

322
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:10,840
But certainly the unique advantage of multi-national
companies to evade, cheat, or not pay taxes anyway...

323
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:15,500
will remain as it is today.

324
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,120
[SAM DASTYARI] Senator Edwards?

325
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:23,460
[SEAN EDWARDS] I know we are running out of time.
Since you have just been through the Canadian inquiry,

326
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:30,780
what evidence did you hear in
that inquiry that most alarmed you?

327
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:41,140
[ANDREAS] I participated only in a short part of that. 
Actually, I was very pleased with the outcome.

328
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:47,220
It seemed that the Canadian Senate was very open
to understanding the nuances of this [new] currency,

329
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:56,320
[willing] to make the type of fine distinctions necessary
between fringe use cases and the overall system.

330
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:02,380
About its behavior, as well as between the types of
activity that need to be regulated, like custodians,

331
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:09,180
versus the types of activities that put power in the hands
of individual users, such as multi-signature [schemes]...

332
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,300
and [non-custodial], individually controlled wallets.

333
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:17,540
I was very pleased with the outcome.
I don't think anything I heard concerned me.

334
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:23,280
[SAM DASTYARI] Just one final question, if it is okay.
I think Canavan may have a final one as well.

335
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:32,020
You said in your opening statement that it is important
to get the balance right (I am paraphrasing)...

336
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:38,820
between providing the right regulatory framework
and certainty [for] businesses, but at the same time...

337
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:46,720
not stifling the attractive qualities of innovation.

338
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,280
The challenge for us, and I wouldn't mind 
putting this to you [as a question], is...

339
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:57,240
How do we get the balance right between what the
industry naturally wants, a regulatory framework...

340
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:04,200
to provide them certainty, so that your Visas
and Mastercards can start properly investing,

341
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:13,440
and at the same time, not creating too rigid of a
framework that effectively displaces the benefits?

342
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:18,320
I know you touched on that as being the challenge,
but [from the perspective of] regulators.

343
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,940
I wouldn't mind just picking your brain a 
little bit on that, before before you leave.

344
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:28,060
[ANDREAS] One of the big problems in
this particular area is, we are dealing with...

345
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:31,080
very disruptive and fast-moving technology.

346
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:36,540
It has only recently emerged into the limelight. 
As a result, there is a lot of uncertainty.

347
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:40,120
We don't really know where
Bitcoin will be in a couple of years,

348
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:47,220
whether it will be used primarily as a
long-term store-of-value akin to digital gold...

349
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:51,160
for [primarily] large transactions
involving [influential] parties.

350
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:56,100
As I like to say, the kind of currency
used to buy aircraft carriers with.

351
00:29:56,100 --> 00:30:04,460
Or maybe it will turn into a currency used for micro,
retail transactions and consumer online commerce.

352
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:06,360
The kind of currency you [use to] buy a cup of coffee.

353
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,500
Or perhaps it will fill both of those 
[functions] at the same time.

354
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,640
There are many unanswered questions at the moment.

355
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:20,160
We are seeing many perceived problems in the industry
being solved with innovation instead of regulation.

356
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:26,340
Just in the last two years, there have been tremendous
developments in security mechanisms for individuals...

357
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:32,520
to protect their bitcoin holdings against hacking
and thieves while controlling [their keys] directly,

358
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:38,080
without giving them to custodial exchanges and other
organizations, where [the bitcoin] can be easily stolen.

359
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:44,920
As I said to the Canadian Senate, a wait-and-see
approach is the most likely to be successful.

360
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:51,960
We saw with the early internet that the wait-and-see
approach allowed the network to thrive and change.

361
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:58,320
[Over time], it morphed into various different
models based on consumer adoption.

362
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,360
Bitcoin consumer adoption has barely started.

363
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:07,920
We don't know yet how the network will reflect the
values of a mainstream community behind it,

364
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,020
or what uses they will put this network to.

365
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:16,200
That is the most exciting aspect of this new technology.
I would caution one thing, however.

366
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:21,100
In the [early days] of the internet, it would have
been dangerous to allow the phone companies...

367
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:23,680
to set the rules by which the internet would operate.

368
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,140
They would have made sure that it wouldn't operate.

369
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:30,740
In the [early days] of the automobile, it would have been
dangerous to allow the railroads to set the rules.

370
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:35,060
Yet that is exactly what they did in
the United Kingdom with Red Flag Act,

371
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:39,920
which stalled development of the 
automotive industry for decades.

372
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:46,760
It was wrong to allow the oil industry to regulate
electricity generation in the United States,

373
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,080
in the early years.

374
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,760
The incumbent industry always wants to 
write the rules for their new competitors,

375
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,880
to make sure that they don't get a foothold.

376
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:59,660
Allowing Visa or Mastercard to define the rules
by which this new payment network will work...

377
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:03,920
will ensure they write rules that won't allow bitcoin to...

378
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:11,840
disrupt their very cozy, staid multi-billion-dollar industry.

379
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:16,600
It has been able to shield itself from 
competition for more than fifty years.

380
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:25,260
It desperately needs strong competition right now,
because it has failed consumers all across the world.

381
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:28,220
[MATTHEW CANAVAN] Do we still have time, Chair?
[SAM DASTYARI] Yes, if you want to squeeze one in.

382
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:32,200
[MATTHEW CANAVAN] If that is okay,
Mr. Antonopoulos, I have two more questions.

383
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:43,680
In your view, you obviously believe that Bitcoin or digital
currency will achieve a greater penetration than today.

384
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:50,380
Do you think [more] people will use custodial accounts?

385
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:54,560
[Will they] maintain their own keys [for their
digital] cash, if you like, on their own computers?

386
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:57,480
Or you think they will use
third-parties to manage that process?

387
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:00,460
I ask that question and relate it
back to the regulatory issue.

388
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:05,620
If they do that, presumably with the transparency
and fingerprints available to authorities,

389
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:10,660
there will not be much difference
from what they currently have with banks.

390
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:14,920
[ANDREAS] I think in some environments, people will;
in other environments, they will not [or can't].

391
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:22,540
In consumer environments where banking relationships
exist and can be extended to existing populations,

392
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:27,260
custodial accounts may be the easiest way to
[become] involved in Bitcoin -- which is a shame.

393
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:33,520
I am hoping that we see enough innovation in security,
user experience and user interface design to allow...

394
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:37,880
more people to [easily] have decentralized 
control over their own money, through Bitcoin.

395
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:43,140
That is the best model by which bitcoin
and other digital currencies work.

396
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:50,860
One of the interesting [developments] will be the
deployment of smartphones with digital currency...

397
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:57,000
in places of the world where banking relationships
do not exist, have never existed, and cannot exist...

398
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,300
simply due to lack of infrastructure and political turmoil.

399
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:05,060
There is an unwillingness [by traditional financial
services] to extend to billions and billions of people.

400
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:07,580
I am far more interested with the possibility...

401
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:14,320
of bitcoin being used on very cheap text messaging
and Android phones throughout Southeast Asia,

402
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:20,420
Indonesia, China, and many of
the places very close to Australia.

403
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:27,600
[This is] where billions of people are currently using
very primitive cash-based or barter-based systems.

404
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:31,240
Their economies are suppressed
as a result of that friction.

405
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:40,160
A very simple smartphone or feature phone could
represent not just a communication mechanism,

406
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:49,920
but a bank service window, a credit service window,
a mortgage origination or stock trading terminal,

407
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,780
or an [entire] import-export business.

408
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:59,480
I can imagine a kid, driving around on a scooter with
an Android phone while running a remittances business.

409
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:04,680
[With a group of such kids], they could [eventually]
deliver billions of dollars into his local economy.

410
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:09,440
In my view, that is the enduring
promise of digital currencies.

411
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:15,460
Today, banking is available to just over 
three million people, on a very basic level.

412
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,780
Only about 1.5 billion people have...

413
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:23,820
the kind of internationally capable, currency 
control-free power banking that you and I enjoy.

414
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:28,440
That leaves four to six billion people outside of the loop.

415
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,980
That is where I think digital currencies will be best used.

416
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:34,100
In those environments,
there is no custodial relationship.

417
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:38,140
Those people will hold the bitcoin
directly on their own devices.

418
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:47,320
[MATTHEW CANAVAN] My last question is, how long do
you think it will be before Bitcoin becomes mainstream?

419
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:54,460
[ANDREAS] The internet took fifteen years.
Cellular telephones took ten years.

420
00:35:54,460 --> 00:36:00,740
The web took seven years.
Perhaps bitcoin will be even faster.

421
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:08,240
It depends on what you mean by "mainstream adoption." 
I already use it, as do a couple million people already.

422
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:16,700
I think [it will take] ten or fifteen years before
it is used by people who are not technically savvy,

423
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:19,540
broadly across all of society.

424
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:23,720
But I think we will see significant 
penetration in the next five years.

425
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,280
[MATTHEW CANAVAN] Okay, thank you.

426
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:30,880
[SAM DASTYARI] Thank you so much,
Mr. Antonopoulos, for making yourself available.

427
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:36,840
I know it was not easy with the technology 
we had to use to make this work.

428
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:42,360
So, I can't thank you enough for
your participation in our inquiry.

429
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:45,980
[ANDREAS] Fortunately, the phone companies
didn't write the regulations for the internet,

430
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:49,660
and that is why I was able to do this today.
[Laughter] Thank you!

431
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:52,960
[VARIOUS MEMBERS] Good luck,
good on you. Thank you, Andreas!
