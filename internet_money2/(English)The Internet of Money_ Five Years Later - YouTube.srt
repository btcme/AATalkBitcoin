00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:35,660
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,330
[PAMELA MORGAN] Now it's time to move to our
second performance of the night.

3
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:44,800
Our next performer is a best-selling author,
prolific public speaker, and a community builder.

4
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,140
He's the reason many of us got into Bitcoin,
and the reason why many of us understand it.

5
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:56,430
He took a break from writing his fourth book,
"Mastering Ethereum," to be here with us tonight.

6
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:01,900
When he's not writing, he's traveling the
world, working to bring education about Bitcoin

7
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,820
and open blockchains to communities everywhere.

8
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:10,460
His Patreon supporters make that work possible,
and they've made this event tonight possible

9
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,340
as well.

10
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:17,869
Most importantly, our next speaker is the
kind of person who would actually organise

11
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:24,950
and host an event like this; one that benefits
a local community instead of himself.

12
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:26,492
Please help me welcome Andreas M. Antonopoulos!

13
00:01:26,492 --> 00:01:27,492
[Applause]

14
00:01:27,492 --> 00:01:28,492
[ANDREAS] Wow!

15
00:01:28,492 --> 00:01:29,492
Thank you, thank you.

16
00:01:29,492 --> 00:01:30,492
Thank you so much...

17
00:01:30,492 --> 00:01:54,890
I can't see any of you.

18
00:01:54,890 --> 00:02:05,020
[Laughter] It's all one big black thing.

19
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:09,000
But I'm just so thrilled to be here.

20
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,040
Thank you all for coming out, thanks for making
it.

21
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,190
Thank you to all of the volunteers.

22
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:19,860
It was a really touching moment this morning;
we did the sound check and practice run, and

23
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:26,610
watching twenty-five people -- who all volunteered
-- scurrying around and getting all the things

24
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:29,820
we had planned and trained for a 1.5 months
together.

25
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:34,220
You made it, so here we are!

26
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:38,360
Thank you.

27
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:46,030
[Applause] They put some yellow tape here
so I don't fall into the moat of lights in

28
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,030
the front.

29
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:50,870
[They] make it difficult because I tend to
pace.

30
00:02:50,870 --> 00:03:00,000
I want to talk about the three components
of this incredible space that we all work,

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,450
live, and breathe every single day.

32
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:12,750
This isn't just a technology, it's not just
an economy, it's not just a community.

33
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:20,220
It's all three [of those things], this multi-faceted
thing where technology, economy, and community

34
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,540
feed off each other.

35
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:31,120
They come in these crashing waves that just
sweep us off our feet and make us feel small,

36
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,500
sometimes elated, sometimes terrified.

37
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,400
You get all these waves of memes...

38
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:53,291
[Laughter] And craziness, and FOMO (fear of
missing out), and HODL, and BUIDL.

39
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:57,110
All of these great community expressions that
we see.

40
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:03,890
The last six months have been weird for all
of us.

41
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:09,080
We watched this incredible run-up in the price.

42
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,920
It dominated the conversation.

43
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:18,910
If you've been in this space for a while,
this isn't new to you; you've seen this happen,

44
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:26,289
this is maybe the six, seventh, or eighth
big bubble-like [trend] where you see this

45
00:04:26,289 --> 00:04:30,600
massive increase in price.

46
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,259
We've seen it before.

47
00:04:32,259 --> 00:04:37,100
I remember, at some point in October, I started
getting calls from journalists.

48
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,990
They asked me to comment on this.

49
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:44,530
They would ask, in a very cagey way, "So what
do you think?

50
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:48,410
Could this possibly, maybe be a bubble?"

51
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:49,410
[Laughter]

52
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:53,919
I [said], "Of course it's a bubble.

53
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,090
We're living in the era of the everything-bubble.

54
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:04,180
But really, it's not the bitcoin bubble you
should be worried about, that everybody is

55
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,030
very aware of.

56
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:12,840
I'd be more worried about the subprime auto
loan bubble, the stock bubble, the bond bubble,

57
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,810
the real-estate bubble..."

58
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:25,380
[Applause] "The student loan bubble, the debt
bubble, the foreign exchange bubble, the tech

59
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,030
bubble, the (everything) bubble.

60
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:37,910
Yes, bitcoin is in a bubble - the most obvious
of the bubbles right now."

61
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:45,770
Twenty-four hours later, someone made a video
with me in a Darth Vader mask...

62
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:51,180
They said, 'Andreas went over to the dark
side.'

63
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:55,990
[Laughter] 'He's calling it a bubble.'

64
00:05:55,990 --> 00:06:00,290
Told you so.

65
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:02,660
All I said was: be careful!

66
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:06,820
Obviously, some people were not careful.

67
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:10,310
Price dominated everything.

68
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:14,861
I think many of you have probably had this
experience: you come into this space, you

69
00:06:14,861 --> 00:06:16,430
don't know what is going on.

70
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:21,150
It's all very weird, complicated, and difficult
to understand.

71
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:27,360
But you find someone who can explain in some
detail, and you start barely understanding

72
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,040
some of the things around you.

73
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:35,620
Then you suddenly realise that even though
you are quite aware that you don't know what

74
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:42,170
the hell is going on in this Bitcoin space
(or in the related spaces, the entire cryptocurrency

75
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:51,540
space), to everyone you know, you become the
"expert."

76
00:06:51,540 --> 00:07:02,020
They come to you and ask, "You know about
Bitcoin... should I invest in IOTA?"

77
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:10,300
[Laughter] "You know about Bitcoin... is this
a good time to get in?"

78
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:16,190
Maybe you told them [to do that] when the
price was $200 or so, and they ignored you.

79
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:18,500
They thought it was silly internet money.

80
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:23,850
But on the morning that it hits $19,000, they
call you up and ask, "Is this a good time

81
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:25,880
to get in?!"

82
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,440
[Laughter]

83
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:36,699
Depending on whether they're a good friend
(in which case you say, "Hell no.

84
00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:47,940
Wait!") or that douche bag who bullied you
in highschool (in which case you say, "Yeah!

85
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:56,270
Now's the time to get in, Chad")...

86
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,380
You wouldn't do that, of course.

87
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:03,259
Everyone in this theater is wonderful, we
wouldn't do that.

88
00:08:03,259 --> 00:08:09,391
But the best part: after you told them to
get in at $200, they ignored you, and they

89
00:08:09,391 --> 00:08:17,300
called you up at $19,000, in January and February
you start getting [another kind of call].

90
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,510
I know you've had them.

91
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:25,449
Someone calls you up and they ask, "Are you
okay?

92
00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:30,800
I saw on CNBC that bitcoin... crashed!"

93
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:37,180
It's "destroyed," it's "gone," it's "down
in the doldrums," it's "a mess."

94
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:40,219
"Are you okay?"

95
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:47,769
Now, let's not minimise the fact that a lot
of people who did go in at $19,000 (probably

96
00:08:47,769 --> 00:08:51,120
in a very ill-advised way) are hurting.

97
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,051
That's not funny, that's a bad investment
decision and you should be very careful because

98
00:08:56,051 --> 00:08:58,180
these things are still extremely volatile.

99
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:03,050
But it is also extremely ironic when people
call you up and ask, "Are you okay?

100
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:04,500
Because we heard it crashed."

101
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:13,529
A year ago, we were just over $1,000.

102
00:09:13,529 --> 00:09:22,269
Price-wise, we're still up a cool 800%.

103
00:09:22,269 --> 00:09:28,769
Your answer should probably be: "You're in
S&P Index Funds - are you okay?"

104
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:30,199
[Applause]

105
00:09:30,199 --> 00:09:42,100
The day that I start hearing about your investment
on TV, you won't be okay.

106
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,100
Nobody will be okay.

107
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:50,880
You see, even my talk here is dominated by
price, which is not something you hear me

108
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,270
talk about a lot.

109
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:56,970
But it's à propos - it's the times we're
in.

110
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:02,110
Then suddenly, the price tanks.

111
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:05,910
The meetups start getting roomy again.

112
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:11,660
[Laughter] The phone calls stop.

113
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:18,439
Some people start laughing at you again, saying,
"I told you it was crazy magic internet money

114
00:10:18,439 --> 00:10:21,220
that would crash..."

115
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:25,119
And the cycle repeats.

116
00:10:25,119 --> 00:10:30,790
Do you guys like farmers' markets?

117
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:34,769
[AUDIENCE] Yeah!

118
00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:43,940
[ANDREAS] If you go to a farmers' market this
weekend, they're going to have two things:

119
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:49,939
rhubarb and pumpkins.

120
00:10:49,939 --> 00:10:54,509
Because it's winter.

121
00:10:54,509 --> 00:11:01,050
You're not going to find a great array of
beautiful organic vegetables; those come from

122
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:03,809
Mexico at this time of the year.

123
00:11:03,809 --> 00:11:10,449
In the local farmers' market, all they can
deliver at this time of year is rhubarb.

124
00:11:10,449 --> 00:11:16,319
In a great analogy to the economic situation
we're in, if you went to the farmers' market

125
00:11:16,319 --> 00:11:21,499
and noticed it's not very popular, you might
say, "Huh!

126
00:11:21,499 --> 00:11:24,110
Farming is dead, I knew it.

127
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:26,779
I saw it on CNBC."

128
00:11:26,779 --> 00:11:27,779
[Laughter]

129
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:35,589
But [the farmers] are about to start planting,
and we are too.

130
00:11:35,589 --> 00:11:38,160
We're about to start planting.

131
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:46,129
What happens right after one of these great
explosions in price, interest, FOMO, and the

132
00:11:46,129 --> 00:11:52,749
crazy rush to the exchanges, is that nothing
else can get done.

133
00:11:52,749 --> 00:12:01,689
Nobody can get anything done because of all
the distraction, of trying to deal with an

134
00:12:01,689 --> 00:12:06,040
influx of newbies, where everyone you meet
is brand-new.

135
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:14,350
And they have questions like: Can't anyone
just guess all the private keys?

136
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:16,879
What happens when the last bitcoin is mined?

137
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:24,290
Not bad questions, the same questions we all
had in the beginning.

138
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:29,209
Nothing else can happen if you're running
an exchange or other customer-facing operation.

139
00:12:29,209 --> 00:12:33,970
You're signing up 150,000 new customers per
week who don't know what the hell they're

140
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:37,430
doing.

141
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:39,879
You do not have time to do anything else.

142
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:45,000
It's all operations, it's fire-fighting every
step of the way.

143
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,149
Coinbase, for example, implemented SegWit
in February.

144
00:12:49,149 --> 00:12:52,279
That's not a coincidence.

145
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:58,360
Right until the end of December and into early
January, they had no time to do anything else.

146
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,120
I don't know this because I talked to them,
I'm just guessing.

147
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,040
We could all see what was happening, it was
absolutely insane.

148
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,399
This was repeated across the entire industry.

149
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:17,869
Anybody who was involved in a business, running
any meet-up or training session, trying to

150
00:13:17,869 --> 00:13:23,100
write the next book and getting fifteen requests
from journalists every single day about 'Oh

151
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:28,129
my god, is this a bubble?'

152
00:13:28,129 --> 00:13:34,839
Everyone was just overwhelmed and that's not
a good time to get anything done.

153
00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:46,429
Harvest time is the craziest time.

154
00:13:46,429 --> 00:13:50,880
That's the time when we start planting the
seeds.

155
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,620
Community and technology lag behind economy.

156
00:13:54,620 --> 00:14:00,149
Right now, let's be honest - the "economy"
isn't about having a lot of economic activity

157
00:14:00,149 --> 00:14:09,350
based on the import / export business, doing
remittances, creating new and crazy applications,

158
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,350
doing micropayments.

159
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:17,339
About 99% of the interest in the "economy"
is just pure speculation and just chasing

160
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:18,730
the very next opportunity.

161
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:23,820
That's okay, we have to go through that phase.

162
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,800
But it is very distracting.

163
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:30,800
Now we can start the real work.

164
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:36,139
In a group like BOB (Bitcoin Open Blockchain
Meetup) or any of the big meetup community

165
00:14:36,139 --> 00:14:40,600
groups, you're going to have this linflux
of people who are excited about the price

166
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,550
and the only reason they came is because of
the price.

167
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,029
Let's be absolutely honest.

168
00:14:47,029 --> 00:14:54,379
They're not interested in the principles of
"debanking all of us," "banking the next six

169
00:14:54,379 --> 00:15:02,790
billion," "freeing the world from the terrifying
oppression of central banks," "returning to

170
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:08,379
a gold standard," or whatever else we might
have as one of our guiding principles.

171
00:15:08,379 --> 00:15:15,629
They certainly don't give a damn about decentralization,
concentration of power, reinventing systems,

172
00:15:15,629 --> 00:15:22,100
creating more human-accessible and global
peer-to-peer markets.

173
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:27,369
They care about whether we're going to the
moon.

174
00:15:27,369 --> 00:15:32,910
But once they've been burned, they're not
going to sell most of their cryptocurrency

175
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:33,910
immediately.

176
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:38,769
They're going to let it sit for a while and
try to figure out what to do next.

177
00:15:38,769 --> 00:15:44,649
Here's the interesting thing: 95% of the people
who came into our industry just during this

178
00:15:44,649 --> 00:15:52,220
big boom have never done a single cryptocurrency
transaction.

179
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:59,579
Their only experience with cryptocurrency
is doing an ACH or wire transfer into a custodial

180
00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:06,069
exchange that printed a number on their screen,
telling them that they have something they

181
00:16:06,069 --> 00:16:10,209
don't actually have... which is cryptocurrency.

182
00:16:10,209 --> 00:16:21,040
They haven't learned the most important rule,
and that rule is: your keys, your coins.

183
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:33,180
[AUDIENCE] Not your keys, not your coins!

184
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:39,239
[ANDREAS] Who is going to teach them that?

185
00:16:39,239 --> 00:16:40,239
You are.

186
00:16:40,239 --> 00:16:41,879
The BOB meetup will.

187
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:45,220
They have everything to learn.

188
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,100
Right now, they know nothing.

189
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:55,749
All they know is that they didn't get to buy
a Lamborghini and they're still trying to

190
00:16:55,749 --> 00:17:00,660
tell their significant other that they're
down by 60% on the "investment" they weren't

191
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:04,829
supposed to make.

192
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:15,970
Now is the opportunity to teach all of the
basics, to educate, to support, and to expand

193
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:18,339
that vision.

194
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:20,069
They came for the price?

195
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:21,570
Make them stay for the principles.

196
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:24,520
They need to understand why we do this.

197
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:28,380
[What is] the best way to [get them to] understand
why we do this?

198
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:35,549
Every single one of you who has a deeper reason
for doing this, express that with authenticity,

199
00:17:35,549 --> 00:17:38,070
with passion, with enthusiasm.

200
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:42,630
Do that face-to-face as part of local community.

201
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:46,180
Now is the most important moment for local
community.

202
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:52,920
Now is when we help educate people on why
we do this, why we care so much about this,

203
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:59,630
and to dispel all of the weird rumors and
myths that they hear.

204
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:03,070
Help focus their education on the things that
matter.

205
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:08,440
Somewhere in that [group of newcomers] may
be a business partner for your next startup,

206
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:18,610
a graphic designer who can help you make a
UX or UI for a wallet that doesn't suck, a

207
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:25,020
marketer who can sell this without resorting
to pictures little gold coins as their only

208
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:31,980
graphic.

209
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:39,050
Somewhere out there is a developer who wants
to follow the same vision that you have.

210
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:43,500
Somewhere out there is an operations manager
who can help you actually turn this into a

211
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,800
viable business.

212
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:52,170
They're going to be at your local meetup.

213
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:54,350
We got the wave of the economy.

214
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:57,240
Now we need to build community.

215
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:06,240
At the same time, people are investing in
startups, building new protocols, planting

216
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:16,010
the seeds in the technology for the next great
wave of adoption so that we can be ready,

217
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:24,050
deliver better user experience, deliver more
applications that are more meaningful and

218
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:26,080
change people's lives.

219
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:32,540
We can make this easier to use, more secure
-- easier to use more securely!

220
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:36,980
This applies to all of the cryptocurrencies
and crypto-assets out there.

221
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:46,350
We are right at the beginning, we are at the
pre-DNS age of the internet.

222
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:48,750
We all love this stuff, we're all into it.

223
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:57,580
We will be willing to learn the hard stuff,
overlook the kludgy interfaces and terrible

224
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:01,200
non-nonsensical stuff that happens in our
industry.

225
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,560
I mean, really -- it is horrible.

226
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,250
Right?

227
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:13,800
This is not the cryptocurrency technology
that is going to become mainsteam.

228
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,570
It cannot be.

229
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:20,220
It's too clunky, it's too complicated, it's
too difficult to understand.

230
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:25,320
It's not intuitive to most and you can make
simple mistakes that could wipe out your holdings.

231
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,450
We need to fix all of that.

232
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:34,130
For every one of those problems, there is
a potential billion-dollar industry.

233
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:38,640
That's how you can tell the difference between
an entrepreneur and someone who only looks

234
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,530
at the doom-and-gloom side.

235
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:48,300
In 2007, hundreds of journalists were writing
article after article about how the internet

236
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:54,560
would fail because no one could find anything.

237
00:20:54,560 --> 00:21:00,360
Larry Page and Sergey Brin looked at that
and said, 'How about we solve that problem

238
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:04,010
instead of saying that it's going to end the
internet?'

239
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:07,350
Right now, right in this room...

240
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:13,800
I know for a fact there are several people
in this room who are working on making the

241
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:31,550
next application, the next great Lightning
wallet, the next big-block Bitcoin Cash application,

242
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:34,540
the next Ethereum smart contract.

243
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,970
It doesn't matter.

244
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:41,400
Build it, make it better.

245
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:51,230
It's too important to lose focus over petty
disagreements and minor issues.

246
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:55,160
[Applause]

247
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,060
I don't care what you build.

248
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,190
Build something.

249
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,740
Make something better.

250
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:09,440
If you're not a developer, send a help desk
request, fix a minor documentation problem,

251
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,970
create a video, paint a painting, make a poster.

252
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:21,690
Get up in front of your local meetup and describe
your experience so that others can be helped.

253
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:27,960
Everyone has a role to play and that's what
community is about.

254
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:33,510
Everybody else thinks the cryptocurrency market
just died in January.

255
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:44,060
They look at the seemingly empty field and
think nothing is happening, yet that field is planted.

256
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:51,140
We're waiting for one good rain, a few days of sunshine,
and we're going to do this all over again.

257
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,870
It's going to be even crazier the next time.

258
00:22:53,870 --> 00:23:02,100
We will be better prepared, with better applications,
education, technology.

259
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,100
And stronger community.

260
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:30,720
Thank you. [Applause]

261
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:36,280
I hope you are all as excited as I am
[for] the next part of this.

262
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:43,580
One of my favourite parts of the evening [is] the
completely out-of-control, random Q&A session.

263
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:51,400
[Laughter] We have microphones in the center section.
Where you see the light over there, is a microphone.

264
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:55,980
If you want to ask me a question,
you go to that microphone.

265
00:23:55,980 --> 00:24:01,400
We have about 10 or 15 minutes to go through
as many questions as you want,

266
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,420
as many questions as we can fit in that time.

267
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:22,740
Line up behind that microphone
where you see the light there.

268
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:25,760
[AUDIENCE] Good evening, Mr. Andreas.
How are you doing?

269
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:30,300
[ANDREAS] Good evening, indistinct
black blob in the background. [Laughter]

270
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:34,780
Very nice to meet you. I can't see anything!
Go ahead. [AUDIENCE] It's nice to speak to you again.

271
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:40,620
My question is, what are your thoughts about
proof-of-work versus proof-of-stake?

272
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:48,980
[ANDREAS] That's a great question.
One of the historical facts that's really...

273
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:55,560
quite interesting is that proof-of-work
was invented after proof-of-stake.

274
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,560
It was invented by [a few people in the 90s
and then utilized by] Satoshi Nakamoto [in Bitcoin]...

275
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:03,380
because proof-of-stake systems hadn't been able to work before.

276
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:11,940
I don't know if they will work now [but] I'm optimistic.
I think proof-of-stake systems are possibly...

277
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:15,160
an interesting way of doing consensus.

278
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:20,020
There are many very smart people 
working on this kind of technology.

279
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:24,400
If you're involved in [technological innovation],
one of the things you learn is that...

280
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:35,420
if you use words like "never," you're more likely to end up
on one of those historic lists of quotes by idiots...

281
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:39,400
[Laughter] who said things couldn't be done.

282
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:44,080
For example, 'heavier-than-air flight is impossible.'

283
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:50,500
'After the Paris fair, electrification will die as the fad it is.'

284
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:54,020
'One telephone should be enough for each city.'

285
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:58,460
'One computer should be enough for each country.'

286
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:01,780
And other great quotes like that, which you can find.

287
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:05,320
I'm not going to ever say you can't do something.

288
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:11,020
I'm actually hopeful, I'm optimistic, and
I would like to see what people come up with.

289
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:15,220
What I can tell you: I think there is a 
fundamental, qualitative difference...

290
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:17,860
between proof-of-stake and proof-of-work.

291
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:24,720
I think there is something very special about
having an extrinsic investment in energy that

292
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:36,420
you absolutely cannot get back, which creates what
I've called a thermodynamic guarantee of immutability.

293
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:40,640
Immutability based on the physics of expended energy,

294
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:45,320
which makes that game theory
very painful if you get it wrong.

295
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:52,260
That has some drawbacks.
A lot of people point to it and say that it's expensive.

296
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:58,700
But compared to what? I think we should add up
all of the armoured cars, lit offices, printed money,

297
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:07,360
bank vaults, and all of the other
waste that goes into fiat. [Applause]

298
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:12,880
There may be truth to the idea that
we can only afford one proof-of-work network.

299
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:19,820
Just one. I think proof-of-stake becomes more powerful
and stronger if you can checkpoint it now and then...

300
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:23,060
into a truly immutable proof-of-work chain.

301
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:28,780
If the only proof-of-work chain we can afford is Bitcoin,
that's a damn good differentiator.

302
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:34,660
[Applause] [AUDIENCE] Thank you, sir!
[ANDREAS] Thank you.

303
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:39,460
[AUDIENCE] Good evening, Mr. Antonopoulos.
To follow up his proof-of-work question,

304
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:44,760
is ASIC-resistance futile? 
Are we at the mercy of Bitmain?

305
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:50,980
Do we all have to buy an Antminer
to have a say in the network?

306
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:56,160
[ANDREAS] ASIC-resistance is futile.
Not only is it futile, I think it's not desireable.

307
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:02,880
One of the challenges of going to supposedly
ASIC-hard algorithms, or resetting the proof-of-work,

308
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:09,460
is that [it is still] possible for people
to recruit botnets, hacking other people's computers...

309
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:17,480
to use them [for mining]. If it's GPU-mining,
they will hack and recruit gamers' computers.

310
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:26,980
Not only does it have that really bad side-effect,
but in the end you can build an ASIC for anything,

311
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:30,520
and it will always be better than a 
general purpose computing system.

312
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:35,420
No matter what you do.
If you need a lot of RAM, you'll add a lot of RAM.

313
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:42,380
If we reset the proof-of-work algorithm to 
"de-throne" the current leader(s) of that system,

314
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:48,180
we've created a level playing field into which any
company that happens to have a couple billion dollars...

315
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:52,740
in spare cash, the operational experience,
all of the fabrication [facilities] ready to go,

316
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:58,080
all of the staffing and warehouses ready to fill with
[machines for] the new proof-of-work algorithm...

317
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,820
can dominate the space. Whoops!

318
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:08,820
We are actually going to make it even more centralised,
because that first-mover advantage will be enormous.

319
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:17,600
Especially for a company that has been obsoleting
and rebuilding their ASICs every three or six months.

320
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:25,200
If you think about it, these companies
are ASIC replacement pipelines.

321
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:32,460
They are very efficient at it. So if you've just pulled their
timeline forward by three months? [Eh, no problem].

322
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:38,140
Rather what I'm interested in, is what happens when
we reach the limits of Moore's Law in terms of density.

323
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:42,300
We're there now. We're looking at 
10-nanometer chips being developed.

324
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:45,040
That creates a level of competition which is interesting.

325
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:50,960
There are no more 10x, 100x,
or 1000x improvements to get.

326
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:58,380
The shelf life of one of these ASIC machines, 
[where it's still going to be profitable], is now 2 - 3 years.

327
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:01,500
That completely changes all of
the economics in the market.

328
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,860
It's going to take a few years for that to play out.

329
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:12,220
But I think we have just reached peak centralisation
in mining, and it's going to get decentralised from here.

330
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:23,360
[Applause] [AUDIENCE] Thank you.
[ANDREAS] Let's see. I could be wrong.

331
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,580
[AUDIENCE] One of the things that
we're always talking about is adoption.

332
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,180
You talked about this often tonight.

333
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:35,560
A lot of people show concern over the transaction fees,
but I'm actually curious about the tax side of things,

334
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:41,140
the regulation and that actually being
a higher percentage of a transaction,

335
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:45,980
if we're having to consider that 
with how the tax code is written currently.

336
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:52,900
What do you see as the roadmap for regulation
to change in order for cryptocurrency to be used...

337
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:56,420
the way we would like it to be used?

338
00:30:56,420 --> 00:31:02,880
[ANDREAS] I'm not very optimistic about how
that's going to play out in the United States, at least.

339
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:12,460
I don't think it's an accident that reporting requirements
for capital gains, for even tiny transactions, are such...

340
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:21,160
that it makes it a nightmare to do your taxes properly,
to be "lawful" in terms of paying your taxes.

341
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:27,440
I know [because] I have to do it.
I do it and it's a huge reporting burden.

342
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:33,220
When you have to [fill out] a 300-page
tax return in order to report $35 in gains,

343
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:44,100
something is fucked up with this system.
[Laughter] [Applause]

344
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:49,820
What I can tell you is, my accountant
(who happens to be in the audience today)

345
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:54,840
is going to make more money than
the IRS is on [my] capital gains this year.

346
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:59,180
For the work [involved in] reporting.
That is backwards, that is messed up.

347
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:04,640
And what is that going to do?
Is that going to stop Bitcoin? In the United States?

348
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:08,980
Or is that going to stop the United States in Bitcoin?

349
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:14,980
You can get your country out of Bitcoin,
but you can't get Bitcoin out of your country.

350
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:24,080
[Applause]
Guess who doesn't report capital gains?

351
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:29,720
Money launderers.
Guess who doesn't report capital gains?

352
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:35,640
Criminals.
Guess who doesn't report capital gains?

353
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:44,260
Well, people in Congress, as we recently found out...
[Laughter] [AUDIENCE] You already said "criminals"!

354
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:52,420
[ANDREAS] When there's a policy in place that is
designed to penalise people trying to do "the right thing,"

355
00:32:52,420 --> 00:33:00,000
while the people who are going to break the law anyway
avoid taxes altogether and are still going to do that,

356
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:07,000
you have to question whether the purpose of that policy
is to support an industry that is still trying to use...

357
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:15,080
technology from the '70s and treat us to a 9-to-5,
Monday to Friday, business-as-usual bullshit system...

358
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:23,000
that they call banking. I think that's the real reason
why you're seeing these regulatory responses.

359
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:33,780
It is [another form of] bail-out for the banks, again.
And it's going to fail. [Applause]

360
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:38,620
But it's going to keep happening and escalating
in many countries around the world.

361
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:44,180
The good news: in the countries where this [technology]
matters the most, where the rule of law is weak,

362
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:50,620
the government is corrupt, and the people 
are mostly unbanked, they don't give a shit.

363
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:58,520
They're going to use it anyway.
This is a losing battle [for the regulators].

364
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:03,380
If you thought this was going to be easy or that
governments weren't going to fight dirty,

365
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:05,860
you might be surprised by this.

366
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:13,160
The bottom line is that no matter what they try to do,
no matter how much regulation they try to impose,

367
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:23,860
they cannot stop this technology.
[AUDIENCE] Thank you. [Applause]

368
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:28,920
[ANDREAS] This is the last question we can do.
[AUDIENCE] Hi Andreas. My question is:

369
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:35,140
The Lightning Network is getting its legs underneath it. Second layer solutions. This is a two-part question.

370
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:43,440
1. Do you think the Lightning Network is going well?
2. If we're going to need a third layer, what is that...

371
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:49,240
going to look like? What is your vision
for a third layer on top of Lightning?

372
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:54,860
[ANDREAS] I think the Lightning Network is going well.
I think there's a general tendency to be impatient...

373
00:34:54,860 --> 00:35:01,080
about technology. "Hurry up and invent it for me,
I've been waiting for two years now!"

374
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:09,100
The truth is that these things are not easy, but the pace
of development has been accelerating across the board.

375
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:20,720
I've been running Lightning nodes for just over 8 months,
running a mainnet node since the end of the year.

376
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:25,320
I think we're going to see more and more applications.
We've barely scratched the surface.

377
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:29,280
I've very excited about some of the
new technologies that are being developed.

378
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:36,720
Atomic multi-path routing, which allows you to
use several small payment channels to make...

379
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:43,400
one aggregate payment that routes
over many different paths, but is atomic.

380
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:48,700
Which means you don't need to create
a channel as big as the payment you want;

381
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:53,480
you can instead create eight small ones and
aggregate them to make a bigger payment.

382
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:58,160
That will lead to more decentralisation 
of the network, which is great.

383
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:03,720
There's another technology that's coming along,
which is payment channel factories.

384
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:12,660
Various cut-through technologies that allow you to open
a channel in the same transaction that you close it.

385
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:20,060
Or to increase the funding in a channel without
[closing the current one] and opening a new one.

386
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:23,660
That basically cuts through funding
and tops up a channel.

387
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:31,200
These are really the third layer. Of course, one of the
things people criticise about the Lightning Network...

388
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:38,240
which I think might end up being one of its greatest strengths, is that it doesn't specify routing algorithms.

389
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:42,320
Right now we have a very basic, flood-based network.

390
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,320
The routing algorithm is fairly simple;
it's called source-based routing.

391
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:52,980
That means every node creates its own route 
to make a payment; the source makes the route.

392
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:58,780
That give us a lot of privacy, but it's
not a very efficient way of routing.

393
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:05,580
There's this other network that also decided not to embed the definition and specifications for routing

394
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:07,140
within the base protocol.

395
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:13,160
I don't know if you've heard of it; the protocol is
called TCP/IP and it tells you nothing about routing.

396
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:24,620
There is not a single line of routing in the TCP/IP
protocol. The first routing protocols for TCP/IP sucked.

397
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:30,240
One of the interesting things is that on a network of
networks, just in the case of the Lightning Network,

398
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:37,740
a network of blockchains, routing is something you can do at multiple layers with multiple different algorithms.

399
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:43,860
Simultaneously. There are more than twenty-five 
routing algorithms that run on the internet today.

400
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:50,180
Local routing, area routing, long-range routing.
Most of you never heard of any of these protocols,

401
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:55,920
yet that technology continues to develop 
and evolve as we need to reach bigger scale.

402
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:02,360
The decision to not put routing into TCP/IP
allowed routing to be developed independently,

403
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:05,960
and to progress much faster than the base protocol.

404
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:13,080
That was the third layer. In the Lightning Network,
the routing protocols we have now are pretty basic.

405
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:18,300
If you think that's a weakness of Lightning,
you haven't been paying attention. That's the third layer.

406
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:22,960
I imagine many different routing protocols 
that can be used for Lightning.

407
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:31,600
One of my ideas that I would love to see implemented
is to route based on metrics other than channel fees.

408
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:40,740
For example, I would like to see the ability to route on
'the most private route,' selecting privacy as the metric.

409
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:42,720
To be able to only select and route through nodes

410
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:49,060
that guarantee they don't keep logs of
any transactions that flow through them.

411
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:54,480
There are so many other ways we can do this,
so I'm very excited to see where the future takes us.

412
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:59,860
This is a massive, active research opportunity
across major universities around the world,

413
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:04,820
that are going to re-invent routing for this new medium.

414
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:10,980
I'm excited to see what comes next.
Thank you everyone, so much! [Applause]
