00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,600
Hello, everyone. 안녕하세요
[Korean: Annyeonghaseyo].

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:19,600
That is all I can say [in Korean]. It took me one hour
to learn how to say that. I watched YouTube videos.

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:29,460
What I want to talk about today is
the five pillars of cryptocurrencies.

4
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:35,880
You've probably heard me say this before, 
but I'm interested in blockchains that are...

5
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:44,800
open, public, borderless, neutral, and censorship-
resistant. Have you heard [me express that before]?

6
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,840
Open, public, borderless, neutral,
and censorship-resistant.

7
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,040
If you watched any of my videos, you've probably
heard me repeat that thing again and again.

8
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:58,420
There are the blockchains that are open, public,
borderless, neutral, and censorship-resistant.

9
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:04,060
Then there is the other kind,
which are... bullshit! Very good.

10
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:13,760
If you want more information on that, [one of] my most
popular videos on Youtube is banned on Facebook.

11
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:19,440
It is called "Blockchain versus Bullshit."

12
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:27,760
Unfortunately, that word was apparently too colorful
for Facebook. "Oh no, you can't say that word!"

13
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:33,800
"You can't say that word on Facebook. We allow
Neo-nazi content, but you can't say 'bullshit.'"

14
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:38,060
So, that [happened]...

15
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:42,980
How can you tell the difference
between a blockchain and bullshit?

16
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:52,420
There are a lot of companies trying to sell things and
attach the word "blockchain" to make their proposition...

17
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,880
more palatable, right?

18
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:02,700
No matter what you are doing, they will
find ways to connect a blockchain to it.

19
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:10,020
My favorite example was Kodak. Do you 
remember Kodak? They used to make film.

20
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:19,600
They invented the digital camera and then didn't use it or
sell it for 20 years, until Nokia [took over] their industry.

21
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:28,640
In 2017, they launched a blockchain project.

22
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,120
[With enough imagination], you can attach 
anything to a blockchain. Let's try it.

23
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:41,560
I say a word, you say "blockchain." Okay, very good.
Asparagus. [AUDIENCE] Blockchain. [ANDREAS] See?

24
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:47,120
If we keep doing this, people will start throwing
money at you. Bus. [AUDIENCE] Blockchain.

25
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,640
[ANDREAS] Healthcare. [AUDIENCE] Blockchain!
[ANDREAS] Supply chain. [AUDIENCE] Blockchain!

26
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:58,560
[ANDREAS] See? Very good. We have already created
four startups that Google would probably fund.

27
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:05,880
After all, this space is called "Google for Startups," which
is a funny name. What does Google do with start-ups?

28
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:12,600
Do they swallow them? Is that the idea? [Laughter]

29
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:19,680
The idea here is, you need to understand what is
important and what is not important in this space.

30
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:27,520
Because there is so much money flowing in and
so much opportunity, there are also a lot of sharks.

31
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:35,620
In the business world, just like sharks
can smell blood from kilometers away,

32
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:39,420
MBAs can smell [venture capital] money.

33
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:47,680
If you put some VC money in the room, they will show up
and start attaching the word "blockchain" to everything,

34
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,320
trying to get funding.

35
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:58,660
We need to understand what is important versus
not important in this space. How will we do that?

36
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:04,160
I set up these criteria, these ideas of what 
is important about the Bitcoin blockchain.

37
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:09,160
Why this all started with the Bitcoin blockchain,
what made it important, and how you can tell...

38
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,800
if something really needs a blockchain.

39
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:24,180
The characteristics of a [real] blockchain are: open,
public, borderless, neutral, and censorship resistant.

40
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:29,740
Let's talk about each one of those.
"Open" means that anyone can access it.

41
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:46,600
Anyone can participate without authorization, vetting,
or identity [verification] of nationality, ethnic origin, etc.

42
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:52,120
The funny thing is, you don't even need to be
human to use a blockchain. That is not required.

43
00:04:52,120 --> 00:05:02,500
Software [agents] can use blockchains. The blockchain
doesn't know if you are a human or piece of software.

44
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:12,880
"Borderless." Like the internet, there are no borders.
This is a truly international phenomenon.

45
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:25,140
That means, it doesn't matter where you are, where you
live, where you travel. The blockchain is already there.

46
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:31,760
Sometimes I go through international airports.
By "sometimes," I mean every week.

47
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:41,620
When I cross borders, they have signs which say, "If you
are transporting more than $10,000 worth in currency,

48
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:50,640
instruments, or convertible instruments, you must
declare them." There is an interesting question.

49
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:58,820
I mean, I have some bitcoin, but am I 
"transferring" or "transporting" anything?

50
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:07,700
I have some keys, which are just numbers. 
Those are not bitcoin. They are like a PIN, right?

51
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:14,580
I look at the other travelers next to me, 
walking across the international border;

52
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:19,280
they probably have a credit or debit card in their pocket.

53
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:26,080
They are transporting that credit card number across
the border. If you asked them if they are moving money,

54
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:35,780
they would say, "No." But there is a credit card in
your pocket. "Yes, but the credit card is not money."

55
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:42,960
"The money is in the bank. I just know the PIN.
I am not transporting money." That is a good approach.

56
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:49,680
I am not transporting bitcoin. My bitcoin
is already in the country where I am going.

57
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:55,460
Somebody downloaded [the blockchain] there.
When I arrived in Korea, my bitcoin was already here.

58
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:59,080
I am just transporting my [keys].

59
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:06,480
I don't want to have that conversation with an actual
border official; they may disagree about the analysis.

60
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:12,580
I also make sure that, when I am traveling, 
my wallet has less than $10,000 [worth of bitcoin].

61
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:19,100
Then I don't really need to have that conversation,
but that [would] create an interesting situation.

62
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:27,560
You would suddenly realize that our laws, 
practices, customs and borders...

63
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:34,560
are based on the idea that
money is [located] somewhere.

64
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:42,600
It is either here or there. If you take it from 
here and put it there, you are "transporting."

65
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:51,980
But what if it isn't here or there? What if it is everywhere?
You are not transporting. This is a really weird problem.

66
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:59,020
Nobody writing that law could even think
of money that was everywhere all the time.

67
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:05,560
It didn't even occur to them,
so none of that makes sense anymore.

68
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:12,080
What does it mean to transmit money 
when money isn't somewhere but everywhere?

69
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:18,400
What does it mean to transmit money when
money is simply a number, a piece of information?

70
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:31,740
For example, I did a demonstration. I took a Bitcoin
transaction, wrote a little script, six lines of Python.

71
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:45,580
I took every byte of that transaction and replaced it
with an emoji character from the Unicode set.

72
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:54,280
The transaction [hash] starts with
[many zeros and random hex code].

73
00:08:54,280 --> 00:09:03,080
That became smiley face, frowny face, rocket,
asparagus, broccoli, banana, monkey face...

74
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:10,420
All the little emojis. Then I tweeted that.
Did I transmit money? I don't know.

75
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:16,780
I am not quite sure if I transmitted money.
I sent a bitcoin transaction as a tweet,

76
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:24,340
consisting of monkey, banana, asparagus, broccoli,
smiley face, frowning face, and heart [emojis].

77
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:30,520
Is that money transmission? Do I need a 
banking license? That would be very weird.

78
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:34,420
But Bitcoin does create these weird situations.

79
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:46,920
"Borderless" means a lot more than you think.
Money has become information, with no physical form.

80
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,120
It does not exist in any one place.

81
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:55,800
It is not a thing of place.
It is a thing of the mind.

82
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:00,520
"Neutral." What does neutral mean?

83
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:09,960
If you operate a business and want to transmit money
across borders, you will have interesting conversations.

84
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,300
Interesting conversations with your bankers.

85
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:18,660
For example, I recently had my
books translated into Russian.

86
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:27,580
I sold [translation] rights to a Russian publishing
company, which sent me a small amount of money.

87
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:38,580
It was about $500, something like that.
It wasn't enough to buy a nuclear weapon, right?

88
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:51,760
Well, they tried to send me $500, but it never arrived.
They said, "We sent it." I said, "Let me call my bank."

89
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,480
I called my bank and asked, "Where is the money?"
They said, "We don't know. We don't have any money."

90
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:03,620
Well, okay. I went back to the Russian publisher
and I asked them. They sent me a receipt...

91
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:06,320
that showed my bank had received it.

92
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:16,060
I took that to the bank and they said, "Oh. Our security
department has stopped it. They don't tell us [why]."

93
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:19,920
"They don't tell you?" "They don't tell us."
"Don't you think that it would be important...

94
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:25,400
tell the person who owns / owned this 
money that you are holding their money?"

95
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:33,780
"No, we can't tell you. There is an investigation
happening." Oh. This sounds exciting. Tell me more.

96
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:38,680
Then they had some questions.
For example, "who is sending you money?"

97
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:43,680
I said, "My publisher in Russia."
"And why are they sending you money?"

98
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,760
"Because I published a book."
"What is the title of the book?"

99
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:58,380
"Uh, it is 'The Internet of Money, Volume One.'
The internet of money is- nevermind."

100
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:06,360
"Who owns the publishing company?"
"I don't know." "Have you confirmed...

101
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:11,080
that the publishing company is not owned by
one of these seventeen Russian oligarchs,

102
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,140
currently under sanctions by the State Department?"

103
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:23,020
"No. It didn't really occur to me that, in order to receive
$500, I must check their names against a watchlist."

104
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:32,880
"Now that I know this is my patriotic duty, let us
all check the database while singing 'USA! USA!'"

105
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:42,080
"I'm sure we will find out." So I checked. The first name
of the person who sent me the money was "Oleg."

106
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,540
They said, "Oleg is a name that is listed on our list."

107
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:49,760
I said, "Oleg is the fourth most common name in Russia.

108
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:55,320
That is like if I received money from 
someone in South America called 'Pablo,'

109
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:01,340
and then they say, "We have a Pablo on our list."
I know that - I have seen the Netflix show...

110
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:05,180
I know that you probably have a Pablo
on your list, but this is the different Pablo.

111
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:15,000
Pablo is a common name. So throughout this entire
conversation with my banker, I'm [dying with laughter].

112
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:28,460
I'm thinking, 'I have read this in a book. Is this
from George Orwell's 1984 or Kafka's Trial?'

113
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:35,140
Because this whole conversation is crazy.

114
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:39,340
Long story short...
Well, long story long, because it is funny.

115
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:52,540
It took me seven months to receive $500 
from the highly suspicious Oleg for my book.

116
00:13:52,540 --> 00:14:00,900
Needless to say, the next time I dealt with the publisher,
I said, "You are paying me in bitcoin. Are we clear?"

117
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:07,500
What does "neutral" mean?
Neutral means that it is my money.

118
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:16,260
At some very basic level, as someone who lives in a
country that has the word "free" printed on everything,

119
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:21,400
I would like to say to the people of my bank,

120
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:28,520
"It is none of your fucking business
why I am receiving $500. It is my money."

121
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:34,120
But I can't say that. If I say that, they will close all my
bank accounts and I will get a knock on the door.

122
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:41,540
Then I must explain to more people who Oleg is,
and these people from the FBI are less friendly.

123
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:49,940
Anyway, "neutral" means that a system of money
should not care who the sender or the recipients is.

124
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:55,920
It should not care what the purpose is.
It should only get the transaction through.

125
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:04,000
It is about the communication of value. 
This seems like a very radical idea.

126
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,500
Radical as in politically unfavorable,
or radical as in dangerous.

127
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:20,580
What if people could give other people money,
without anyone else knowing about it?

128
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:29,200
That sounds like a pretty dangerous idea. Oh no, wait.
That is how the world worked for thousands of years.

129
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:34,360
In fact, until the 1990s, that is how the world worked.

130
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:40,480
People could just give other people money. 
People still can, it is called cash. Even internationally.

131
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:46,760
People could give other people money without
anybody else knowing what purpose it was for.

132
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:51,680
What happened that was so bad, that now 
[we have decided] we need to check everything?

133
00:15:51,680 --> 00:16:01,360
I am pretty sure Oleg isn't the main source of funding
for terrorism. At least, I hope not. I would get in trouble.

134
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:11,200
"Censorship-resistant." Censorship resistant means,
if someone wants to stop me from sending money,

135
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:18,620
they can't because this is a system of speech.

136
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:28,560
Money is communication. Whether others 
believe that I have a human right to speak,

137
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:37,960
a human right to associate, to express myself,
to support political causes and organizations...

138
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:41,400
that I choose, is their problem.

139
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:48,740
I have those human rights. I didn't ask for them.
They weren't given or granted to me. I have them.

140
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:53,540
There is a hint in the actual [term]: human right.

141
00:16:53,540 --> 00:17:00,580
It starts with the most important
qualifying word, being human.

142
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:07,520
That is the requirement. Are there any other humans
here? You all have them? Great. Congratulations.

143
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:18,420
The idea is, money, like any system of 
communication, is part of human rights.

144
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:22,600
There are a lot of governments
who disagree with that idea.

145
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:27,540
There were a lot of governments who disagreed
with the idea of separating church and state.

146
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:36,040
There were a lot of governments who disagreed
with the idea of people voting, especially women.

147
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:45,780
Governments have disagreed with a lot of ideas
but they have changed, because we know better.

148
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:57,820
Hopefully, in thirty to fifty years, we will come to
understand why we should separate money and state,

149
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:03,620
for exactly the same reasons that we 
should separate [church] and state.

150
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:14,200
If money has a purpose in commerce and you
turn it into a police or militarized control system,

151
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:21,500
a system of war, it will stop working as money.

152
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:29,580
That is a problem. If you start destroying your economy
in order to do law enforcement, to support war,

153
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,080
you will destroy your economy.

154
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:44,280
But there is a bigger problem. If you give other people
control over where you can or cannot spend money,

155
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:56,020
those other people may decide that you shouldn't
spend money financing their political opposition.

156
00:18:56,020 --> 00:19:00,360
Pretty soon, that kind of power turns into corruption.

157
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:08,000
That is why we separated church and state in most
civilized countries, because they corrupt each other.

158
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:19,900
If you bring the banks and the government 
a bit too close together, they become very corrupt.

159
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:23,580
The banks corrupt the government;
the government corrupts the banks.

160
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:28,940
Then they all destroy the economy together.

161
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:37,680
These crazy radical ideas, we call them
the Enlightenment. Classical liberalism.

162
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:44,100
Human rights. From this, we got this crazy 
idea that we could also apply it to money.

163
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:53,940
We now have this system that is open, public,
borderless, neutral, and censorship-resistant.

164
00:19:53,940 --> 00:20:04,120
"Public," where everything you do is verifiable on
the network by everybody else. No one can cheat.

165
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:11,340
You can run software which can tell you definitively
if a transaction has [been confirmed] or not.

166
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:18,340
With these principles, we built a new system
of money.The question is, what happens next?

167
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:26,280
Who needs this? Who uses this?
How will it develop? Will governments allow it?

168
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:33,320
Will governments try to stop it? They can't stop it,
but we don't know the answers to those questions.

169
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:40,660
What we do know is, for the first time
in history, we have these capabilities.

170
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:44,180
We have taken them a bit further. It is not just money.

171
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:52,640
With smart contracts in systems like Ethereum...
I'm interested in that and wrote a book about it.

172
00:20:52,640 --> 00:21:03,040
These concepts now extend to more complicated,
more sophisticated systems that allow for other things.

173
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:12,580
For example, build corporations that are not registered
by the state or domiciled in a specific location,

174
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:17,260
but operate as independent entities on the blockchain.

175
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:27,740
We call these "decentralized autonomous organizations"
or DAOs, which is a stupid name. [Laughter]

176
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:36,500
Anybody who hears that name thinks, "What?"
It doesn't really tell you what this thing is.

177
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:47,220
It is a cross between an association, like 
this meetup, and a corporation or company.

178
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:59,720
I believe you call them...
I can't pronounce it, but I know what it is.

179
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:12,700
[They could] range from your local neighborhood
association, up to the most powerful company.

180
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:20,600
You can express them as a network-based 
entity that exists outside of borders.

181
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:31,100
What if we made a company open, public, 
borderless, neutral, and censorship-resistant.

182
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:36,240
Interesting things could happen.
Interesting things are happening.

183
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:42,560
I want to focus a bit more on "open."
Most people misunderstand what that means.

184
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:49,900
One layer of "open" is the idea that anyone 
can participate, in any way they want,

185
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:56,000
simply by downloading the software.
We understand what that means.

186
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:02,980
But there is another interesting [aspect]. 
We are not operating these blockchains in isolation.

187
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:10,160
We are operating them in a competitive environment
against existing financial services and systems.

188
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:24,720
How many here use PayPal? Venmo?
How many people here use KakaoPay?

189
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:35,920
I can't use KakaoPay. I tried to, but it wants me to have
a Korean phone number. Instead, I pay with credit cards.

190
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:46,060
How many people use KakaoPay?
Those systems are not open, for two reasons.

191
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:54,600
They are not open in terms of 'can I open an account,'
because I don't have a Korean phone number.

192
00:23:54,600 --> 00:24:02,140
That is one example of not being open. In order to
use the system, I must be authorized with something,

193
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:05,420
an identity card or phone number.

194
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:08,640
I can't just download software
and operate on the network.

195
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:16,960
There is another much more interesting aspect of
"open." How many of you here write applications?

196
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:22,600
Excellent. How many of you have written 
an application that runs on KakaoPay?

197
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:32,980
Oh, you can't. Why not?
Can you write an app that runs on PayPal?

198
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:41,620
A library, a protocol, a network, a platform?
You can connect to it and make payments,

199
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:44,780
but you can't extend or modify it.

200
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:52,020
You can't build something
different, something unauthorized.

201
00:24:52,020 --> 00:25:00,160
I can't build an application that [handles] KakaoPay
for people who don't have Korean phone numbers.

202
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:10,920
Why not? That is where the second aspect of "open"
comes into play. You might think this a small thing.

203
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:20,060
Obviously, it is their network. Why would they allow
me to build applications that change the network?

204
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:27,640
Think about it in a different way. That means
all new [features] must come from them.

205
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:32,320
If I come up with a great idea,
I can't [implement it on their network].

206
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:38,200
I must build a completely [separate] payment
network just to run my idea on top of it.

207
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:47,540
I can't simply run it on top of theirs.
Their system is closed in another way.

208
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:56,140
It only allows innovation from the inside,
and they think that is a good thing.

209
00:25:56,140 --> 00:26:01,580
I think that is a great thing,
because that [crutch will allow us] to win.

210
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:17,680
With open blockchains, any one of you can [create] an
application for it, even change how the system works.

211
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,980
It can do something that nobody authorized.

212
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:34,060
You could [create] something very different, 
weird, or even illegal, and no one can stop you.

213
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:43,040
This is a type of radical openness, not simply
because you are allowed to access the platform.

214
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:53,500
It is the opposite; you cannot be stopped from
accessing it. It is not just open, but uncloseable.

215
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:57,380
Does that make any sense?
This is a really radical idea.

216
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:05,060
You can write an application, connect to this network,
and do things that nobody had considered before.

217
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:12,420
You don't need too many users. You only 
need one other person to run that application.

218
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:20,840
Between the two of you, there is innovation 
for a market of one or two people.

219
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:27,100
Then you can do something even more radical:
make your application open.

220
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:36,600
Somebody else can build on top of your application.
Then they can make their application open too.

221
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:44,600
Then somebody else [can] come along and now
everybody is building on top of each other's ideas,

222
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:48,320
without asking for anyone's permission.

223
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:56,900
What happens then is really astonishing.
We have seen it once before, with the internet.

224
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:06,260
This is what happened with the internet, which wasn't
that we had some companies make great platforms.

225
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:16,020
You didn't need anyone's permission to launch an
application. You could launch, let other people use it,

226
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,740
to launch another and another.

227
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:26,780
It created this tsunami of innovation that 
completely overwhelmed all possible competitors.

228
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:33,940
This will happen to banking.
They cannot compete against that.

229
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:41,800
Inside a company, there is no way you can produce the
amount of innovation of the entire world put together,

230
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:49,160
all operating to serve their own special purpose,
without asking for anybody's permission.

231
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:56,220
This is a really important point. At first, [most]
people don't understand the difference between...

232
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:00,220
PayPal, Venmo, KakaoPay, and Bitcoin.

233
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:06,300
They think, 'It is an app on your phone
that reads QR codes to make payments.'

234
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:16,460
'So what? I have been able to do that with PayPal
since 1995.' That is where they are missing the point.

235
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:30,140
It is not an app. It is a platform. A radically open, public,
borderless, neutral, and censorship-resistant platform.

236
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:33,360
Thank you. [Applause]
