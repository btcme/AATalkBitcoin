1
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,140
All of this started on [October 31st, 2008 with the]
publication of a paper, [and on January 3rd, 2009]

2
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:22,140
with the publication of a piece of software by an
anonymous contributor who used the name...

3
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,060
'Satoshi Nakamoto.'

4
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:33,800
They proposed a system of electronic cash, but with
unique properties that had never been seen before.

5
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,260
A system that is decentralized,
meaning no one [entity] is in control.

6
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:48,220
A system [with] certain mathematical properties
which enable a phenomenon called digital scarcity,

7
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:53,640
meaning you can have something that
is simultaneously digital and yet rare.

8
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,760
It cannot be copied, which seems like an antithesis.

9
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:07,300
The quintessential characteristic of digital 
information is that it can be freely copied;

10
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:11,700
you can create infinite copies of it at almost zero cost.

11
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:18,660
But you can't create infinite
copies of bitcoin at zero cost.

12
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:32,800
This idea of having a digital thing that is rare and cannot
be copied, was a unique and revolutionary invention,

13
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,620
[which has] not happened before [in computer science].

14
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:45,840
A decentralized peer-to-peer network that [relies on]
participants in the currency to validate [transactions].

15
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:55,640
If I make a transaction, everyone who is 
running a Bitcoin [node] will validate it,

16
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:00,700
checking every aspect of my transaction.

17
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:10,520
[It is] an open system for securing and 
sequencing transactions that ensures...

18
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:19,080
no one can spend the same [outputs] twice, solving a
fundamental problem in distributed systems known...

19
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:25,060
as the Byzantine Generals' Problem.

20
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:31,640
The basic idea is: how do you know
if I spent digital money [only once]?

21
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:38,740
If I give it to one merchant, what stops me from taking
the same digital [money], walking across the street,

22
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:41,700
and giving it to another merchant?

23
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:51,740
Until the invention of Bitcoin, there was only one suitable
answer: a central authority records all the transactions.

24
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:57,600
When that central authority sees the first transaction,
it will not allow a second transaction [spending it again].

25
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:03,740
That works, it is very efficient. Visa does it.

26
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:08,640
If you buy something for $10 in one shop 
with a Visa [card], then go across the street...

27
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:16,180
and buy something else for $10, they will make sure
you have at least $20 in your account to pay for it.

28
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:21,960
They won't let you spend the same money twice,
they won't let you spend more than you have,

29
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:26,180
or more than your credit allows. That's great.

30
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:31,460
Those systems work. They are efficient and can do
hundreds of thousands of transactions per second.

31
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:40,540
But there is one problem: you are trusting that
organization or company [with your money].

32
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:45,860
You are not just putting trust in that company
to do it right, because they do a pretty good job.

33
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:53,380
With that trust comes enormous power:
the power to refuse to take your transaction;

34
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:58,120
the power to refuse to give you an account;
the power to refuse your participation in...

35
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:11,140
this economic activity; the power to demand that you
identify yourself, show papers, prove credit-worthiness.

36
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:15,920
That is something which is different from 
all systems of money we've had before.

37
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,459
I can use cash without showing papers, 
without proving credit-worthiness.

38
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:25,570
I don't have an intermediary, pay [them] a 
transaction fee, or need special equipment.

39
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:29,120
I can just transact directly, person-to-person.

40
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:37,840
When you introduce this third-party company, you have a
problem. Let's say I have a Visa card in my back pocket.

41
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:46,680
I want to give one of you $10. Who in this crowd
can process my Visa card [transaction] today?

42
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:54,700
Can anyone take a Visa card from me?
Not in your business, but in your personal capacity.

43
00:04:54,700 --> 00:05:00,960
Who accepts Visa here? No one, not a single person.

44
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:06,100
Because [that system is not] about people 
paying people, it's people paying companies...

45
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:10,220
to pay companies to maybe pay people.

46
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:12,500
Bitcoin is peer-to-peer.

47
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:19,960
Our financial systems have become peer-to-
corporation-to-corporation-to-corporation-to-peer.

48
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:25,860
Everybody takes a little cut, everybody 
[asserts] their own power in the system.

49
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,540
They take great advantage of that.

50
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:34,800
What is the end result? Billions of people 
who have no access to the banking system;

51
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,720
billions of people who will
never have a bank account.

52
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:45,000
Many of them don't have [identity documentation],
and even if they did, still lack the necessary education,

53
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,180
literacy and numeracy, to walk into a bank.

54
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:53,220
Or they "look wrong," because they are
from the "wrong" race, caste, or religion.

55
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:59,020
The untouchables can't walk into a bank; they will be
kicked out by security before they reach the teller.

56
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:09,020
This happens all across the world, a direct result
of the fact that we have centralized our money.

57
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:18,500
Bitcoin is different. It allows us
to use digital money like cash.

58
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:27,020
By the end of today, everyone in this room will be able
to accept bitcoin, directly under their own control,

59
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:31,120
with software running on their smartphone.

60
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:39,180
At that point, I can pay you or you can pay me.
We can [engage in] commerce on a local level,

61
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:48,460
as a community, without involving any third-party
intermediary or corporation that has power over us.

62
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:57,520
Without the requirement to present [identity documents],
without the requirement that you are credit-worthy.

63
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:05,240
You fulfill human-worthiness.
In fact, Bitcoin doesn't even require that.

64
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:16,760
You don't need to be human; autonomous software can
use bitcoin on its own, without humans involved.

65
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:22,300
The invention [of Bitcoin] in 2009
launched a completely new era.

66
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:32,280
It is not just a weird form of PayPal.
This isn't just a new system of payment.

67
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:49,140
Bitcoin takes an obscure branch of mathematics called
cryptography, the art of secret writing using math,

68
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:59,480
[which] is then applied to the domain of establishing
trust between participants in a [distributed] system,

69
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,560
without giving any one [entity] control over the system.

70
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,480
This unique property is what makes Bitcoin special.

71
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:14,960
You can send money to someone else without knowing
them, without [needing] to trust them or anybody.

72
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:25,820
You can trust that the mathematical rules in the
system guarantee that money you receive is real,

73
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:39,140
unforgeable, and spendable (as soon as it clears
in about ten minutes) by you in another payment.

74
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:46,460
You don't need to know the person who gave it
to you. In modern finance, that seems weird.

75
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,440
And yet we do it every day with cash.

76
00:08:49,440 --> 00:09:04,100
If I tip my taxi driver with a 2,000 rupee note,
do they need my [identity document]?

77
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:08,940
Do they need to 'process a transaction'? 
Do they need to 'pay a transaction fee'? No.

78
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:13,920
Cash is a representation of value.

79
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:25,300
[To] verify that it is [not a fake], the person who receives
it [may] hold it up to the light, look for a watermark.

80
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,640
They can [usually] do that on their own,

81
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:36,200
they don't [need] to call someone and
[ask if] serial number 1323532 is a real one.

82
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,000
You don't need to check with
a third-party or central authority.

83
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,649
You can verify with your own eyes that it is real money.
Bitcoin translates that [ability] into the digital domain.

84
00:09:46,649 --> 00:09:58,200
If you receive a bitcoin transaction, the [node] software
you run can independently verify that it is real,

85
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,800
without asking anyone else.

86
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,900
[If that is the case], the identity of the 
person who sent it to you is irrelevant.

87
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:12,500
The value is there. You don't need to trust them.

88
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:24,960
That is revolutionary in a way we've seen once before at
least in my generation: the introduction of the internet.

89
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:33,100
Many people who [grew] up with the internet still
fundamentally misunderstand why it is special.

90
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:41,040
They look at the internet and see it as a [platform
for] publishing, a system of [digital] content.

91
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:46,880
But we had publishing [platforms] before the internet,
we [even] had digital publishing before the internet.

92
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,320
We had ways to disseminate
"content" [long] before the internet.

93
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,840
What was different about the internet?

94
00:10:52,840 --> 00:11:07,860
For the first time ever, it enabled a global free flow
of information, almost everywhere on Earth,

95
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:14,660
to anyone who had the technical capability to connect.

96
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:22,840
As long as you have the technical capability,
the internet doesn't care who you are, how old you are,

97
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,940
whether you are a human or a software agent.

98
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:28,260
[It doesn't care] what race, religion, or gender you are.

99
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:34,500
[You have] the power of the free flow
of information without restriction.

100
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:44,000
That is the magic of the internet, the transformative
power of that technology: the free flow of information.

101
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:57,160
To many people, this idea is terrifying, that anyone can
say anything, read anything, speak about anything.

102
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:07,500
Without control, without a license, qualification, diploma,
certificate, or even an identity. Without censorship.

103
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,080
[To many, this is] terrifying.

104
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:17,820
For my generation and generations that follow,
it is not only liberating, it [will be] normal.

105
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:24,860
It is the way things have always been
and it is the way things should be.

106
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:32,300
Bitcoin creates the exact same circumstances,
for the first time, in the category of money.

107
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:42,000
It enables the free flow of money, the free 
flow of trust, across the world to anyone,

108
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,020
simply through their choice to participate
[in the system] by downloading an application.

109
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:55,980
The free flow of money, the free flow of value,
the free association of trust; that is what it's about.

110
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:03,380
It is not an investment scheme. It is not just a
payment network or a weird version of PayPal.

111
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:09,880
It adds the free flow of money to the other 
freedoms the internet already gives us.

112
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:16,960
I guarantee you this is a terrifying idea to many
[people], that anyone can send money to anyone...

113
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:26,260
without asking for permission [from an intermediary],
without control, censorship, or identity, is terrifying.

114
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:34,240
My generation finds it liberating.
The generation after mine sees it as normal.

115
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:40,400
They will never know a world in which you
cannot send money anywhere to anyone;

116
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:45,380
a world in which money only works
from Monday to Friday, nine to five;

117
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:51,540
a world in which the privilege of having
a bank account costs you a monthly fee,

118
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,000
for other people to store your money;

119
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,060
a world in which some destinations are prohibited;

120
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:05,580
a world in which, in order to open a bank account,
you [must] be [at least] sixteen years old.

121
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:15,540
[These will] seem like bizarre ideas. Get ready for
a world in which six-year-olds have bitcoin wallets.

122
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:22,920
I've met them. They love the fact that
they can now buy things on the internet.

123
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:28,560
Parents will find that terrifying,
but they will see it as normal.

124
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:36,840
Ten years [later], they will walk into a bank because
Grandma wants to give them a savings account.

125
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:49,140
They will have a conversation with a banker, which will
seem as bizarre as talking to an 18th century privateer.

126
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:56,440
In order to open an account, they need to present
all kinds of documentation and paperwork,

127
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,180
a process that will take an hour.

128
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:07,360
Afterwards, they have limited access for a high fee, only
during working hours (Monday to Friday, nine to five).

129
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:13,540
[This] account can only use one currency and only send
to certain destinations, most of which are corporations.

130
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:18,860
An account they can't use to send money to their
friends or to buy things [easily] over the internet.

131
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:29,180
They will look at that and say, "My grandparents
are crazy. Why would they use this? It is broken!"

132
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:38,840
"It is almost as bizarre as when they asked me to send
a fax. I don't understand it." This is the world we created.

133
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:46,500
This [is happening]. The people who are afraid of
this idea don't really realize that [it is happening].

134
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,160
We live in a new world.

135
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:57,900
There are two ways we can adjust: pretend it is not
happening, or accept it and adapt to the new world.

136
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:04,900
We now live in a world where you can send value
anywhere, to anyone, at any time, without restriction.

137
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:09,280
We can embrace that or pretend it's not happening.

138
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:15,080
In my previous talk, I used an analogy
that I think worked quite well.

139
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:23,260
If you turn on the [weather channel] and the weatherman
[says] there will be a rainstorm this afternoon,

140
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:32,260
but that doesn't suit your plans because [there is an
outdoor] birthday party, you can turn off the [television].

141
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:43,840
If you're powerful, maybe you can complain to the news
station and [convince them to fire] the weatherperson.

142
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:49,040
[But no matter what you do],
it will still rain [this afternoon].

143
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:55,780
Governments are looking at Bitcoin and the 
first questions which come to their minds are:

144
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:58,520
"How do we control it? How do
we change it? How do we stop it?"

145
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:12,060
"How do we enforce our authority, our legal purview?"
They look at it, but don't understand the basic concepts.

146
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:25,680
They ask questions like, "Who is in charge? 
Who controls this?" The answer is not satisfactory.

147
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:31,580
[Laughter] No one controls this. No one is in charge.

148
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:36,220
Or you can go for the more sophisticated approach:

149
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:45,840
"Well, it's based on an open-access model, with
market-based competition through risk and reward,

150
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:54,140
based on game theoretical outcomes that ensure
collaborative participation by multiple participants

151
00:17:54,140 --> 00:18:00,220
without anybody having the ability to cheat,
due to a system of emergent consensus...

152
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:04,240
based on mathematical rules and strong cryptography."

153
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:18,600
[Applause] To which they respond, "Yes, yes...
but who is in charge? Who is in control?" [Laughter]

154
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:25,940
I've had people come up to me after meetings
and say, "Okay, I won't tell anyone. This is just us."

155
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:40,160
[Laughter] "Who is in charge?" They think I'm
joking or trying to massage the information.

156
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:49,260
It [does seem] bizarre to say, "Here is a system
of trust without authority, without a center."

157
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:54,960
"A system without hierarchy, without control." Why?

158
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,580
Because we've never had any of those things [before].

159
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:04,280
Every system of trust we've ever had in our
society is based on the exact same model:

160
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:11,240
a 19th-century hierarchical organisation 
that is the outcome of the industrial era,

161
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:18,360
a bureaucracy based on internal
processes, rules, and oversight in layers.

162
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:28,940
[There is always] ultimate authority vested in someone
elected through democracy -- or perhaps who is not.

163
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:37,200
Maybe it's hereditary, maybe it's dictatorial, but you
can always point [to someone on the pyramid].

164
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:44,540
You just let your eyes follow to the top,
usually there is [one person] at the top.

165
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:51,800
In some cases, that person is [merely] an actor, with
a whole shadowy group playing the puppet strings,

166
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:55,920
but nevertheless authority is vested in that person.

167
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:02,900
Then you look at Bitcoin, and it is a flat system.
There are a few people who seem to have special roles.

168
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:14,020
You [wonder], "Maybe those people are in control.
Is it the miners or the developers? One of the nodes?"

169
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:20,880
Then you noticed that these people alone can't
actually do anything [to change consensus].

170
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:30,780
The funny thing is, when people look at Bitcoin,
they see its greatest strengths as flaws.

171
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,820
which is [a common reaction to] new technology.

172
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:41,380
They look at Bitcoin and say, "The miners and developers
can't even agree on how to scale the system!"

173
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:49,160
Why doesn't one of the groups just say, "This is
how we will do it"? Because that is not Bitcoin.

174
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:58,600
[No one has] that ability. It is a system of 
adversarial competition with market forces.

175
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:10,840
We are in deadlock because consensus overrides
personal ambition, popularity, and everything else.

176
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:17,100
They look at Bitcoin and say, "You keep squabbling,
you can't [seem to] make a decision." Yes, by design.

177
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:20,400
That is a feature, not a bug.

178
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:33,080
They look at Bitcoin and say, "But you can't reverse
a transaction! That is a problem! That is a bug!"

179
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:44,180
"How can you do that? What if something goes wrong?
Who do I call to reverse it?" Feature, not bug.

180
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:49,020
Bitcoin guarantees the execution
of [whichever] scripts you put into it.

181
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:56,580
If you put the script that says, "Here is one bitcoin.
Now I hope you send me that television I ordered."

182
00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:01,120
That is the script [which will] be irreversible
and guaranteed by the network.

183
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,440
It is not a very good script [in this case], 
because they may not send the television.

184
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:11,240
There is no one who can make that bitcoin come back
to you, other than the [merchant], once you've sent it.

185
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:20,940
That is one form of irreversible promise. Of course,
that is not the only promise the network can guarantee.

186
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:30,460
I can say, "Here is one bitcoin. It is currently locked
in a multi-signature address for the next thirty days."

187
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:39,280
"After thirty days, if there is no dispute, it will
automatically transfer to you upon verification...

188
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:44,820
by a trustworthy third-party who I have chosen."

189
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:48,380
I can introduce third parties if I want to,
[but] I don't need to [have third parties].

190
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:57,040
I can introduce reversibility if I want to, but 
[the conditions of] that script are still irreversible.

191
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:02,060
I can choose who my escrow agent is;
I can choose who does dispute resolution.

192
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:06,360
I can [still utilize] the feature of irreversibility,

193
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:16,780
but I can soften that promise to apply consumer
protection through programmable money.

194
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:21,300
It is a feature, not a bug.

195
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:29,400
Bitcoin is this strange being, it really is. 
It violates everything we think we know about money.

196
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:35,420
It forces us to consider whether we actually
understood money in the first place.

197
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:45,700
Do you remember when you were in school and
did that class about basic economics and money?

198
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:53,820
No? You neither? We didn't do it either.

199
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:59,980
You would think that one of the
world's most ancient technologies,

200
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:12,020
one of the resounding artefacts of human civilization --
currency, the basis of trade that dominates our lives --

201
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:15,000
would be an important topic at school.

202
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:22,820
Not one day. Maybe, in some places, you did
a brief course in home economics or history,

203
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:27,580
that gave you this vague idea about money 
that you really didn't understand.

204
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:34,520
Most of us cannot hold a fifteen-minute 
conversation with a six-year-old about money.

205
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:44,300
The six-year-old has good questions and we [usually]
have no answers. "How does money work, Mommy?"

206
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:51,880
Well, the correct answer is:
"I don't have a freaking clue, kid."

207
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:59,100
I think it has something to do with the 
allocation of special drawing rights...

208
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:04,160
through the International Monetary Fund 
and World Bank, in a free-floating system...

209
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:10,020
[where currencies] compete through trade 
balances across an international spectrum...

210
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,520
of inflation-adjusted exchange rates.

211
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:20,180
These can be used to create local debt issued
by the Treasury, in return for currency...

212
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:26,680
printed by the central bank, then distributed 
to banks that use a system of...

213
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:33,960
partial reserve leverage at approximately 
10-to-1, and dispersed into the economy.

214
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:42,580
This creates either inflationary or deflationary effects,
allowing us to experience the velocity of money...

215
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:49,000
through the exchange of an abstract token 
that represents the promise of future value,

216
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:58,820
but is depreciated by the rate of inflation
and adjusted for the return on investment.

217
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:14,560
[Applause] "So why can't we have more of it, Mommy? 
Why can't we just give everybody more of it?"

218
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:21,640
That conversation doesn't go that way. Usually,
it ends with: "Eat your breakfast" or "Go to bed!"

219
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:25,820
"Clean your room." "One day, you'll understand."

220
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:30,980
And that is the first lie, because
you still don't understand.

221
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:39,700
If you ask the average person on the street, 
"what gives value to money," they have no idea!

222
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:54,700
They have a theory, a fairytale, a story which is about
as naïve as believing that children come from storks,

223
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:59,240
delivered in bundles dropped through the chimney.

224
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:05,340
[The story] is about as solid as Santa Claus.

225
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:13,460
What gives money value? It says right there, on
the piece of paper, [something along the lines of]:

226
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:22,800
"By the full faith and credit of the Royal Bank of India."
"By the full faith and credit of the Federal Reserve."

227
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:38,920
It says, "one note applies to all debt, public and
private." This is what gives it value: a promise.

228
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,820
But most people have no idea how that works.

229
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:47,080
I guarantee that if you ask the average person the
street, they will tell you the reason money has value...

230
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:53,080
is because there is a cave, vault, or box 
somewhere [with] the government's gold,

231
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:57,080
in direct proportion to the money that circulates.

232
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:01,360
This has not been true since
the 1930s, anywhere in the world.

233
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:06,680
Yet that is the Santa Claus
fantasy many people believe.

234
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:17,080
Or they believe the government guarantees 
the value of money somehow, which then...

235
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:26,720
[raises] other interesting questions: why does inflation
happen? Why is the currency collapsing in Zimbabwe?

236
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:33,280
Did the government not try hard enough to guarantee it?

237
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:40,660
That is the inconvenient truth at the core of 
the world's most ancient technology, money.

238
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:54,320
We don't understand it. We simply don't. 
The truth is: you give money value. Why?

239
00:28:54,320 --> 00:29:04,160
You are participating in a shared hallucination
[of sorts], with 1.5 billion other people,

240
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:09,840
in which you firmly believe that this
money will still have value tomorrow;

241
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:15,800
that if you go to the store and present
one of these colored pieces of paper,

242
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:23,440
someone will give eggs, chicken, spices, 
water, sugar, salt, housing, healthcare, etc.

243
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,760
Something for this colored piece of paper.

244
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:36,140
It takes an incredible hallucination for us to believe
this, because the paper itself is [almost] worthless.

245
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:41,480
It [can be] pretty, but it is not pretty at that level.

246
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:49,120
Nobody gives you products or services 
because of how pretty it is.

247
00:29:49,120 --> 00:30:01,440
That shared hallucination took hundreds of years
to be established, starting in the late 15th century...

248
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:09,220
with the introduction of paper money, gold certificates,
IOUs, certificates of exchange, bearer notes, etc.

249
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:13,380
[These were just] pieces of paper that could be
exchanged for something else, [as a promise].

250
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:28,100
In the most amazing magical trick, they switched
the cups around, you lift the cup, and ball isn't there.

251
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:37,040
What? This was supposed to be redeemable for
an ounce of gold, a pound of silver, something!

252
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:42,620
Nope, not anymore. It is just a piece of paper.

253
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:49,040
What gives it value is your belief that, if you go
to the store tomorrow, you can buy something.

254
00:30:49,040 --> 00:31:01,440
The moment that belief suffers a crack,
it shatters, and you have very big problems.

255
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:11,000
Imagine some crazy scenario where the promise of
"the full faith and credit" turns into an announcement.

256
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,860
As of four hours from now, these two 
pieces of colored paper have zero value.

257
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:22,700
I mean, that couldn't possibly happen... [Laughter]

258
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:28,620
Here is the interesting [part]: if the value was
based on the promise, that promise is broken,

259
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:36,940
and the people who gave that promise now
tell you this [paper] has zero value in four hours,

260
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:40,740
what is the value of that piece of paper?

261
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:48,480
Zero, right? But that is not what happened at all.

262
00:31:48,480 --> 00:32:03,220
For months after that announcement, the paper was
valued less (10%, 15%, 20% less), but it still had value.

263
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:10,360
Even though [they] told you it was [worth nothing],
you could still exchange it at 80% face- value...

264
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:18,440
in one of the many locations where "corruption no longer
exists, you can't exchange money here." [Laughter]

265
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:26,980
You know that story, unless of course you are connected
and wealthy enough to afford the 20% depreciation.

266
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:34,920
It still only depreciated by 20%. I bet you 
could still find some in circulation today.

267
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,460
I bet they still don't have a value of zero.

268
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:45,260
In fact, we rarely find [the value of any] 
currency in history that goes to zero.

269
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:53,880
I can go to Rome in Italy and [buy] silver coins
[with] the face of Julius Caesar on them;

270
00:32:53,880 --> 00:33:02,980
[they] have not been in circulation for almost one
thousand years, and yet their value is not zero.

271
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:12,650
In fact, their value exceeds their worth in silver. 
They are still a tradeable abstraction of value.

272
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:25,640
Your money did not go to zero because its value
was not the promise; its value was that illusion.

273
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:31,080
That illusion was shaken, but not destroyed.

274
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:34,900
You panicked at first, thinking, "This has zero value!"

275
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:43,020
Then someone says to you, "Don't worry, I know this guy
who knows a guy, who [will exchange] it at 80% [value].

276
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:48,140
Now it has just depreciated [in value].

277
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:55,740
You give it value through your use;
you give it value by believing in that promise.

278
00:33:55,740 --> 00:34:00,080
In order for that promise to hold,
it [needs] some other characteristics.

279
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:06,520
It [must] be unforgeable; if it can be forged, 
then you [will see] an emerging phenomenon...

280
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:13,560
known in economics as Gresham's Law, 
where bad money chases out good money.

281
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:21,100
If you get your hands on the "good" money, you
do not spend it. You stuff it under the mattress.

282
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:24,180
Sound familiar? It happened here.

283
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:30,440
If you have an old note and a new note, 
there is no way you will spend the new note...

284
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:33,580
until you are rid of all the old notes.

285
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:43,320
The new notes disappear from circulation, their
velocity goes [down] as people trade old notes.

286
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,620
If they trade the old note, then it is [still] in circulation.

287
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:53,420
The longer it remains in circulation, the longer
people hold on to it and hoard the new ones.

288
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:58,100
Gresham's Law in action. I did not believe 
that I would see that in my lifetime.

289
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:07,400
Thank you, India, for validating my economics professor
by demonstrating the Law with 1.5 billion people.

290
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:14,400
[The experiment] sucked [and was very] painful,
but nevertheless had very interesting economics.

291
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:27,540
Money [must] be unforgeable and portable.
Why did you not pay with gold at the door?

292
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:31,800
I'm sure [the conference organisers
would] accept gold; I certainly would.

293
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:36,480
The reason you don't pay with gold
is because gold sucks as money.

294
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:47,940
It sucks as money is because, for the value that
it contains, its weight is unrealistically heavy.

295
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:55,740
You can't make it lighter, its density is fixed. 
Gold sucks as currency because it is not portable.

296
00:35:55,740 --> 00:36:02,280
At the moment, other currencies have a similar situation.
Zimbabwe's currency sucks because it is not portable.

297
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:10,380
To buy a cup of coffee, you need a wheelbarrow of cash.
I watched a BBC interview where they asked a farmer,

298
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:13,360
"Aren't you worried someone will steal your money?"

299
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:24,860
They said, "No, I'm worried someone will steal my
wheelbarrow. It is worth more than the money in it."

300
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,940
Bad money chases good money out.

301
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:32,400
[Good money must] be unforgeable, 
portable, and universally recognizable.

302
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:40,040
You [should] be able to validate, independently
verify for yourself, that this is real money.

303
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:47,020
It [must be usable] as a unit of account; you need
to be able to count [the value of] things in it.

304
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:54,260
One of the reasons barter is not working,
is not a suitable form of economic [exchange]...

305
00:36:54,260 --> 00:37:02,000
at any scale more than the extremely local, 
is because of the burden that pricing [involves].

306
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:11,620
Yes, I can give you a chicken for a goat.
I can give the hairdresser a chicken for a haircut.

307
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:21,490
I can give the water-carrier a chicken for litres of water. 
Barter, on a theoretical level, is effective.

308
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:38,100
But now I [would need] to track the exchange rates
for goats, haircuts, and water in units of chicken.

309
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:46,840
Meanwhile, the hairdresser has to track the price of
a haircut in chicken, goats, rice, sugar, salt, water,

310
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,840
[and probably] accounting services, etc.

311
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:58,560
We [would need[ to track every price exchange rate for
every unit of value we are exchanging as commodities.

312
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:05,040
The whole point of money is that you only
[need] to track everything [against] one thing,

313
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:13,820
[which] has no value [in itself because] you 
can't eat it, drink it, or use it to cut your hair.

314
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:20,460
It is not the value, it is the token of value, 
the representation of value.

315
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:26,700
It [must] be unforgeable, portable,
and useful as a unit of account.

316
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:38,820
Then come the difficult [characteristics]. It [must] be
rare. If you live on a beach, you can't use seashells.

317
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:43,660
Yet [groups of] people [who lived] in the 
mountains used seashells as currency.

318
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:51,800
From archaeological dig sites, we find that 
ancient people used seashells as currency;

319
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:57,420
never [if they were] on a beach, always in 
the mountains, because [seashells] were rare there.

320
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:05,560
On the beach, they used crystals, quartz, and minerals,
because [those] come from the mountain.

321
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:12,980
As long as [a lot of it] doesn't exist
where you are, it is a great form of money.

322
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:17,040
[And there lies] one of the big problems
we have with our money systems today.

323
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:26,520
I have bad news for you: the rupee is not rare.
It has no limit. It can be created in infinite quantity,

324
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:33,460
just like the dollar, the euro, the yen,
and all other [fiat currencies].

325
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:46,420
Worse, the power to decide how much to create is
vested in people who have direct conflict of interest.

326
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:56,080
If you are a debtor, then you want the money
to be worth less, so you [need to] repay less.

327
00:39:56,080 --> 00:40:03,240
If you are a saver, you want the money to be worth
more, so that you can [buy or earn] more [with it].

328
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:09,180
If you give the government -- the biggest debtor of all
-- the [power to decide] how much money [to print],

329
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:14,340
they will print money [to infinity] in order to 
make sure that [their debt] is worth nothing.

330
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:20,540
In this process, they transfer
wealth from savers to debtors.

331
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:29,740
In a culture of savers, that [would be] a terrifying thought
You [would need to] explain it in a calm way,

332
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:32,319
and [use a few] little nifty tricks.

333
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:42,200
We tell people, "The a rate of inflation will not
exceed 2.2% per year." It sounds innocuous.

334
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:51,160
What is 2%? I don't even know [how much that] is.
I didn't pay attention in school. It [involves] division.

335
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,880
I was never good at division.

336
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:58,300
[What would] 2.2% do? If you tell people
the rate of inflation is 2.2%, they [will think],

337
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:02,960
"Eh, two percent, five percent, ten percent...
I don't really understand [the effect of] that."

338
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:12,880
Let's rephrase it: in ten years, [about 25% of the value of]
your money will be gone. "Holy shit! I understand that!"

339
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:19,780
[Laughter] "I save [money] like crazy, I work two jobs,
and I barely get paid. Now [a quarter] of it will be gone?"

340
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:26,240
"Where does it go? Who took it from me? 
Catch those people, they are thieves!"

341
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:31,000
"Oh my god, [a quarter of] my money in ten years?!"

342
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,500
Inflation took your money. More accurately,

343
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:41,700
the government, corporations, and banks 
in debt took your money through inflation.

344
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:52,620
For them, the money they owe is also worth 
[25% less] in ten years. What a brilliant construct.

345
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:57,780
That is where we see a fundamental difference
between bitcoin and traditional money.

346
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:04,760
Bitcoin is money. Bitcoin is a store of value, a medium
of exchange, and can be a unit of account (eventually).

347
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:10,760
It gradually acquires these characteristics as it grows
more stable, well-established, and well adopted.

348
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:16,560
As more people participate in the exchange of
value through Bitcoin, they create an economy;

349
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:25,740
that economy creates value, that value 
[leads to] liquidity, stability, reduced volatility,

350
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:31,700
and the reduced volatility makes it more suitable
as a medium of exchange for smaller purchases.

351
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:38,840
It makes it better as a store of value.
[As those increase], its velocity increases,

352
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:43,540
[meaning each] unit gets transferred
many times by people doing [various] trades.

353
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:49,820
Eventually, the value stabilises to a point
where it can become a unit of account.

354
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:57,520
Where you can say, "A talk is worth half a bitcoin.
I don't price in rupees anymore, [I price in bitcoin]."

355
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:01,600
I can't do that today because it is still too volatile,
but one day I will be able to do that.

356
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:11,420
One day, I will price my bitcoin in [satoshis]. 
People ask me, "How much is a bitcoin worth?"

357
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:14,800
The correct answer is: one thousand millibits.

358
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:20,760
There will come a day when the question 
is not "how many rupees is a bitcoin worth,"

359
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:27,720
but "how much bitcoin is a rupee worth,"
and I will say, "[A rupee] is worth a microbit."

360
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:35,940
That is when you [will] know things have changed. 
It will happen very slowly, and then all at once.

361
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:38,980
There is something special about a global currency.

362
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:44,980
Here is the magic: twenty-one million [coins]
is the limit. It is mathematically imposed.

363
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:48,880
There are not any currencies which can do that.

364
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:54,700
There is only one thing in the world which shares the
characteristic of a fixed, geometrically diminishing...

365
00:43:54,700 --> 00:44:06,620
supply that [becomes harder
to extract] the more you try: gold.

366
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:11,320
Except you can't email gold. You can email bitcoin.

367
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:22,580
Suddenly, you notice [Bitcoin] may have a bigger
impact than any of us could even imagine.

368
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:30,780
People will point at it and say,
"It is fake money, it is not real!"

369
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:38,840
But the market will give it a [price],
and in the end that value is the truth.

370
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:50,320
You can use currency controls, propaganda, lies,
restrictions, and laws, [like they do in Venezuela].

371
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:55,240
They point at Bitcoin and say,
"That is fake money, it is not real!"

372
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:59,920
But anybody who is involved in Bitcoin points right
back at [the Venezuelan government] and says,

373
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:09,020
"Oh no, yours is the fake money. This shit is real,
because I can buy food with it from Amazon."

374
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:13,500
"Delivered to Colombia and smuggled across
the border, but I can still buy food with it."

375
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:18,240
Fake money can be resolved by the market.

376
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:25,340
We are [still] at the very beginning [of Bitcoin]. This is not
an investment opportunity or a get-rich-quick scheme.

377
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:32,860
This is a technology which has radical, 
disruptive implications for the world at large.

378
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:37,780
For the first time in human history, it creates
the possibility of a free flow of money...

379
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:52,600
anywhere, at any time, without restriction, 
controls, or [identity], for all of humanity.

380
00:45:52,600 --> 00:46:01,680
That technology [will] be difficult to use.
It [seems] weird. [There will be] attacks, hacks, failures.

381
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:07,180
The internet used to go down
all the time in various parts.

382
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:12,140
Some of the companies [currently] in this 
space will not exist ten years from now;

383
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:14,200
that also happened with the internet.

384
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:23,620
In 2000, [about] 90% of the companies were
wiped out in a single stock market wash-out.

385
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:29,540
But the internet didn't go anywhere, it just found
new companies to build the next generation.

386
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:32,470
That will happen in [cryptocurrencies] too.

387
00:46:32,470 --> 00:46:37,440
We may change the name, we may change 
the companies that are participating.

388
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:47,060
We will certainly change the technology [in various
ways], but in the end, [Bitcoin] will happen.

389
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:56,420
It will be a fundamental part of the future of humanity.
Absolutely nothing can stop that from happening,

390
00:46:56,420 --> 00:47:06,960
because it already did. Thank you. [Applause]
