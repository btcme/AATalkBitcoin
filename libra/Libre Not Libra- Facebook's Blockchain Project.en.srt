1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:08,120
I think you are all probably thinking the same thing.
You have a burning question. I felt like...

2
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:13,540
I wouldn't be able to do the rest of my speaking tour
without addressing this burning question.

3
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:26,140
I was bombarded on Twitter today with the same
question: "Have you tasted haggis?" [Laughter]

4
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:29,800
The answer is, "No, I'm too scared."

5
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:35,380
I made the mistake of reading about
how it is made before tasting it.

6
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:40,280
I've been told that you should do it the other
way around, because then it is a lot less scary.

7
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:46,240
I'm trying to build up the courage. I have been
told that the best way to [eat] this is in a burger.

8
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:52,320
I don't know if that is actually true. No? Okay.
There is a big disagreement in the room.

9
00:00:52,320 --> 00:01:04,260
On the count of three, all those in favor of haggis burger,
[raise your hand]. Nobody? Okay. Haggis for breakfast?

10
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:13,100
[AUDIENCE] Yeah! [ANDREAS] Ah, okay.
Are there other formulations I should try?

11
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:20,380
[AUDIENCE] Haggis on toast!
[ANDREAS] Haggis on toast, very good...

12
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:28,360
[AUDIENCE] Intravenous. [Laughter]

13
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:34,640
[ANDREAS] How about a corporate-sponsored
haggis that is pretending to be an open haggis?

14
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:42,180
[Laughter] And was launched this morning? Okay.
Let's talk about the elephant in the room: Libra.

15
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:49,580
This morning, you probably heard that 
Facebook announced their "cryptocurrency," Libra.

16
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:56,280
Whenever the price of bitcoin goes down,
I receive calls from friends and family,

17
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:09,120
asking if I am okay. "Are you okay? Is everything okay?"
This time, I actually got a call from a friend's mother.

18
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,500
She asked me if I'm okay and
the price has not even dropped!

19
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:23,180
Just the fact that Facebook launched a cryptocurrency
led to the "Are you okay? Are you holding up?" question.

20
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:31,460
"Do we need to airlift you out of Europe?" I am okay.

21
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:40,000
I talked about this two or three years ago, 
that one day we would see this happen.

22
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,180
Today is the day, right? It is now happening.

23
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:52,060
But what exactly happened?
What can we talk about today?

24
00:02:52,060 --> 00:03:04,600
This morning, Facebook released a white paper.
Not a cryptocurrency. Not a network. Not a project.

25
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,460
Not even an application.

26
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:14,040
Just a white paper. Everybody is freaking out because
they wrote a whitepaper. But there is a long road...

27
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:23,040
to go between the white paper and a production
network available to two billion users, wrapped in...

28
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,340
a candy-colored Farmville interface.

29
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:35,820
But when they released the white paper, people became
really excited. How many of you read the white paper?

30
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:42,420
Excellent, quite a few. I'll be honest with you,
I did a brief skim. It has been a busy day.

31
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:48,880
I received a bunch of calls from journalists who
wanted to talk about it. I am not ready to talk about it.

32
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:54,820
This will take a lot more study. I will not
talk too much about the technology today.

33
00:03:54,820 --> 00:04:03,240
We don't really know how this will play out. 
I want to talk about what has changed.

34
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:09,220
Everything changed this morning. This is something
we have been predicting for more than three years.

35
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:17,320
It changes everything, whether or not 
Facebook is able to get Libra into production.

36
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:25,860
The mere fact that this whitepaper was dropped
has now set the bar. They dropped the gauntlet.

37
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:36,020
Silicon Valley is coming for banking in a big way.
We predicted that this would happen.

38
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:44,260
A lot of people thought it would be Amazon first.
But turns out, it is Facebook - which is much worse...

39
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:48,480
than anyone had imagined possible. [Laughter]

40
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:58,000
All right, about the whitepaper. If you haven't looked, this
is a collaboration [between about] thirty [companies].

41
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:06,040
I have a feeling that within Facebook- Some people
are saying this is the result of a year's effort.

42
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:15,000
I have a feeling that they created this incubator /
sandbox innovation lab, gathered thirty to forty...

43
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:25,280
bright people, locked them in a room, and slid pizzas
under the door until the whitepaper came out.

44
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:39,360
The whitepaper is actually very impressive, in terms of
the technology vision. These people are very serious.

45
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,400
[They seem] well-informed about what we are doing
in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space.

46
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:52,760
They cherry-picked some features of the best
cryptocurrencies, the state-of-the-art technology,

47
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:57,080
and then they [plan to] advance it a bit.

48
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:02,880
They synthesized it into something that [sounds]
quite impressive from a technology perspective.

49
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:11,620
It has taken ideas from Ethereum, like a virtual
machine for execution of smart contracts and gas.

50
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:19,880
A Merkle state tree that can be added to Merkle
Mountain Ranges, or the Ethereum state tree.

51
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:29,180
An embedded or intrinsic digital currency. 
A proof-of-authority, federated network of validators,

52
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:39,580
similar to Ripple or EOS, things that
are kind of blockchains but not quite.

53
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:46,580
Their consensus algorithm is not exactly new.
It is a Byzantine fault tolerant consensus algorithm,

54
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:50,980
which is not proof of work, but they say 
they want to move it to proof-of-stake.

55
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:55,340
Some very interesting stuff there.
They mashed [these components] together...

56
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:59,040
and created something that is impressive 
from a technology perspective.

57
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:04,940
It is impressive because of who did it,
not based on what was actually done.

58
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:11,180
If I had released that whitepaper with thirty 
collaborators, everybody would have [shrugged it off].

59
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,940
"Okay, there's another blockchain..."

60
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:23,160
But when a company with two billion users does that,
people understand that this could have a big impact.

61
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:33,200
Now we will see whether this [idea] survives its
first contact with Facebook's corporate [managers].

62
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:41,100
At the moment, this is an incubated project.
It is idealistic. It is [rather] aggressive in its vision.

63
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:47,740
It is focused on being decentralized,
a bit now and even more in the future.

64
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:54,380
Permissioned now, permissionless in the future.
Proof-of-authority now, proof-of-stake in the future.

65
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:57,220
A very progressive, aggressive vision.

66
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:02,760
But that vision will run straight into a bunch of
MBAs and lawyers at Facebook headquarters.

67
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:10,580
"Whoa there!" [Laughter]
Or maybe not. Let's see.

68
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:16,360
It will be really interesting to see how much 
of this vision survives into deployment.

69
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:28,220
That will determine what happens next. If it survives
into deployment, it could become very successful...

70
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,420
and a huge moneymaker.

71
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:34,180
The MBAs will become very excited.

72
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:40,060
Some things in the white paper are quite surprising.
For example, the use of an association to segregate it...

73
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:46,320
from Facebook, and a promise to not use the
profile information on your Facebook account.

74
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,000
Do you have a Facebook account? I sure as hell don't.

75
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:59,720
[Will they] use that in collaboration with the currency?
That would be a no-no, right?

76
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:06,200
At the moment, it says that information
will not be shared and used for surveillance.

77
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:15,940
It will not be used for any of these- Oh, one second.
Sorry. "We are sending you this very important email...

78
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:24,660
to notify you about changes to our Terms & Conditions.
Please reading the following 600 pages of gibberish...

79
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:29,560
to understand how we completely removed 
due-process and your privacy. Thank you very much!"

80
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,460
"The Facebook Team." [Laughter]

81
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:36,380
So that email just came to me from the future.
It was written by an MBA.

82
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:40,660
It will change all of those promises
the moment this becomes successful.

83
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:46,060
If you think that I'm kidding,
look at what happened to Whatsapp.

84
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:51,640
The founders of that company started
with the same kind of idealistic vision,

85
00:09:51,640 --> 00:10:00,820
and left, forgoing hundreds of millions of 
dollars in pay and bonuses. "Use Signal."

86
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:07,260
"Do not use Whatsapp if you are a dissident,
an activist, or a political operative."

87
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:13,640
"If your communication's confidentiality will 
make the difference between surviving or not,

88
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:23,340
if you are one of the millions of people who is marching
in Hong Kong this week, don't use Whatsapp."

89
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:30,720
Will something similar happen? I'm a bit of a cynic.
I think that large corporations have a tendency to...

90
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:38,400
swallow innovation, rip out the disruptive 
[parts], and spit out something neutered.

91
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:46,040
Something that is profit-making while exploiting users,
because that is their obligation to their shareholders.

92
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:50,800
But we will see. Maybe it won't be so.

93
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,840
That is what happened on the
technical front this morning.

94
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:58,180
Now, everybody is trying to solve
what I call the three-body problem.

95
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:07,160
Until now, we were looking at this space as 
the interaction between two major forces:

96
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:16,100
on one side, we have nation-state fiat money,
as we derisively call it in the crypto space;

97
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:23,820
on the other side, we have the people's money, open
and borderless cryptocurrency for everyone to use.

98
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:30,540
These two forces are orbiting and
exerting pressure on each other.

99
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:36,500
Right now, cryptocurrencies are
a [bunch of] tiny little asteroids.

100
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:44,820
Fiat is a big planet full of very successful life forms,
who are looking up at the sky and wondering,

101
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:52,400
"What is that shiny thing? It seems to be getting bigger."
You know, the experience of the dinosaurs.

102
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,900
[Some say], "Don't worry, it's pretty.
Look at how nice the sunset looks!"

103
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:00,020
"Oh, it keeps getting bigger..."

104
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:05,200
Solving the two-body problem from a political
perspective, trying to figure out what happens...

105
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,840
when nation-states and open cryptocurrencies collide,
is difficult enough.

106
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:16,340
We can't tell, because nations are 
positioning themselves in different ways.

107
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:25,420
Some are freaked out and ban it outright. 
China has banned it about 1,726 times so far.

108
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:31,480
All ineffectively. India has banned it, kind of, twice.

109
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:41,600
Ecuador was one of the first to ban it completely.
Yet in many advanced nations, cryptocurrencies...

110
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,140
have actually been thriving.

111
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:55,320
In what we call "free societies," the idea of banning
private currency is constitutionally problematic.

112
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:02,140
Both the United States' Constitution and 
the United Kingdom's constitution protect freedom-

113
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:05,700
Oh, wait. You don't have [a constitution]. 
Anyway... [Laughter]

114
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:11,440
The Magna Carta, let's say, protects freedom of speech.
Money is a form of political speech.

115
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,160
That is something cherished in free societies.
It is not so easy to just ban [cryptocurrencies].

116
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:27,720
But there was a lot of tension this morning, with a big
discussion on Twitter that I reluctantly got involved in.

117
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:38,180
It was about whether Facebook's Libra is a 
cryptocurrency or not. Let's take a quick poll.

118
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:45,580
All those who say that it is a cryptocurrency, [raise
your hand]. All those who say it is not, [raise your hand].

119
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:54,820
All those who haven't decided yet, [raise your hand].
That is okay. I don't think that question makes sense.

120
00:13:54,820 --> 00:14:05,980
It doesn't make sense because Facebook's 
Libra is new. It is a corporate digital currency.

121
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:18,900
We haven't seen corporate currencies since the
opium wars, medieval feudalism, and the Medici.

122
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:35,140
How fitting that with the dawn of corporate neo-
feudalism, one of the leading corporate states,

123
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:40,360
the supra-nation of Facebook,
is launching its own currency.

124
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:50,840
Things will become very interesting, for a number
of reasons. We now have a three-point stand-off.

125
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:58,360
It is now money of the corporations, money 
of the people, and the money of government.

126
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:07,180
All three will exist. None of them are going away soon.
In fact, more will join. The doors have been opened.

127
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:14,780
Facebook is the first of the FANGs;
the rest are baring their fangs and ready to go.

128
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:18,640
"FANGs," if you don't know, [stands for] 
Facebook-Amazon-Netflix-Google...

129
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:29,400
and the billion-dollar tech companies of Silicon Valley.
There is also Twitter, Uber, and Airbnb.

130
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,520
The era of internet currencies just opened.

131
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:37,700
Silicon Valley is coming for the banks,
in a way that has never happened before.

132
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:43,460
The bankers have been very comfortable until now.

133
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:49,980
I went to a conference in Zurich and spoke 
to banking executives in 2014. I told them,

134
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:58,280
"Listen. Instead of hiring blockchain consultants to
show you how to square a circle, undo the disruption,

135
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:05,280
and pretend to do blockchain, you should hire
a former executive from the music industry."

136
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:10,140
"Ask them what it felt like when
the internet came for their industry."

137
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:19,400
"When did you realize you couldn't do anything about it?
How did you feel when you started losing to Apple?"

138
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:26,940
Guess what? The banks had [more
than] ten years to figure this shit out,

139
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:30,100
how they would handle digital currencies.

140
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:37,060
The music industry should have made a deal
with Napster; instead, they fought with tooth and nail,

141
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:39,980
and handed the entire industry to Apple.

142
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:47,840
The banks should have made a deal with Bitcoin
when it was the cuddly gecko of cryptocurrencies.

143
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:58,720
Facebook is a Triceratops [of social media] and it is
coming for their industry, to disrupt a lot of things.

144
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:08,580
[It may sound] really weird, but the first
to be affected by this will be retail banks.

145
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:15,520
Not the big bad investment banks who make
shady deals to bail out dictators and stuff like that.

146
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,100
The banks that actually serve customers.

147
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:24,180
Most big investment banks stopped taking checking
and savings customers [in consumer markets]...

148
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:26,440
four or five years [ago].

149
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:35,000
"You people don't pay enough.
You're not worthy of banking."

150
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,400
But retail banks, the corner branch
where you know the banker,

151
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:48,640
or at least [you can call them] to
discuss your overdraft ballooning again.

152
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:54,740
Those retail banks actually serve customers,
even the unbanked and underbanked,

153
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,400
gradually expanding their reach.

154
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:06,860
They will be hit hard by this new phenomenon,
because Facebook not only has two billion users,

155
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:11,500
but they know all their preferences
and behavior patterns.

156
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:23,760
They can use that to drop the cost of banking
and wrap it in a candy-colored user interface.

157
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:32,420
Every time you make a purchase [with Libra],
the application will tickle your dopamine receptors a bit.

158
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:43,660
It will encourage you to do or not do certain things,
play with you like a mouse in a psychology experiment,

159
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:48,800
where you can't see [the edges of]
the maze because the walls are too high.

160
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:53,400
This will be very interesting as it plays out.

161
00:18:53,400 --> 00:19:01,140
To those of us who have been paying attention to 
the rise of techno neo-feudalism, it is terrifying.

162
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:08,760
Facebook will be effective at disrupting regulation 
in a way that banks have not been able to.

163
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:18,600
Facebook is now going after central banks.

164
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:23,920
Yes, they have a basket of currencies
to create some kind of stablecoin thing,

165
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:30,500
but that stablecoin will be stable vis-à-vis 
your local currency that is hyperinflating.

166
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:36,220
I talked about that this morning. Imagine that
you are the government in India or Argentina,

167
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:46,000
and you want to follow an inflation or devaluation policy,
but 10% of your population has moved on to Libra.

168
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:54,500
They can put their savings in the "hard" currency
of Facebook. Well, not really a hard currency.

169
00:19:54,500 --> 00:20:00,540
It doesn't really have a monetary policy, so they say,
but it is harder than the Argentinian peso.

170
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:07,960
It is harder than the Turkish lira, the Indian rupee, and
more than a hundred currencies around the world.

171
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:14,400
The central banks will lose one of the big
levers of power they have over the economy.

172
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:21,860
What will they do, ban Facebook?
Shut down 10% of their economy? They will try.

173
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:31,020
They have been trying to ban Facebook during protests,
coup d'états of dictatorships, and revolutions.

174
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:36,040
They will fail. They will try to regulate Facebook.

175
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:43,020
Imagine the poor regulators,
paid almost nothing, in their tweed suits.

176
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:53,360
Academics from the economics ministry, facing 
an army of Wall Street lawyers in their tiny country,

177
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:58,640
filling the parking lot of the local airport
with Gulfstream [aircraft] in a row,

178
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:04,600
"Let's talk about what we will do to your economy."

179
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:14,060
If you didn't realize it, Facebook is planning 
[to launch] consumer and retail level SDRs.

180
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:19,000
Who knows what an SDR is? A few people.

181
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:25,260
The International Monetary Fund is a global institution that is not [officially] controlled by governments.

182
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:28,020
It uses contributions from member states,

183
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:33,920
a basket of currencies, to issue a pseudo-
currency called Special Drawing Rights.

184
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:37,620
[SDRs] are part of the international framework
of free-floating exchange rates.

185
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:44,040
They are the lender of last resort for governments.
They do so in a very predatory manner.

186
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:53,960
They impose extreme austerity on the governments
which fall into their clutches, asset-strip their industries,

187
00:21:53,960 --> 00:22:00,260
their water plants, railroads, and 
telecommunications companies.

188
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:04,300
Well, guess what? Facebook wil do that now.

189
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:12,140
If you think about what Libra is, it is a special drawing 
rights pseudo-currency, based on a basket of currencies,

190
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:20,720
that is funded by consumer activity, in the same
countries where the government will ask them...

191
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,960
for a loan or try to curtail their activity.

192
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:30,920
This is very serious stuff.
We just went post-national.

193
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:37,160
The power to control money used to be
the exclusive prerogative of states.

194
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:43,600
That has been kicked in the nuts by Bitcoin and
[threatened with] decapitation by Libra this morning.

195
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:52,820
Central bank control over monetary policy 
ended this morning. Technology companies...

196
00:22:52,820 --> 00:23:03,040
currently worth a trillion dollars [total] are 
taking the ability to mint their own money.

197
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:11,480
They will radically transform their business models,
generating more money than you can ever imagine.

198
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:20,520
Very soon, they will dwarf the GDP of at least
one third of the nations on this planet.

199
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:25,560
When the IMF comes calling,
most governments cower in fear.

200
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:32,340
But they have no idea how much worse it will be
when Facebook, Google, or Apple comes calling.

201
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:39,900
Maybe even Twitter can take down a few governments.
It is big enough. Why not? Soon, Uber will be dictating...

202
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:48,020
not just to taxi drivers, but to the local council
and maybe even the cabinet of ministers.

203
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:55,860
We [are approaching] a new world in which three
forces will be competing: money of the people,

204
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:59,180
money of the state, and money of the corporations.

205
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:08,720
That is a crossroads. We need to make some very
careful choices. I am hopeful for a number of reasons.

206
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:15,380
They will actually make a contribution to
the technology, whether they want to or not.

207
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:22,180
They will introduce one billion people
to the wrong kind of cryptocurrency,

208
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:37,000
just like AOL introduced people to the wrong kind of 
internet. [Applause] Here is where it becomes tricky.

209
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:43,580
At this point, we need to decide how
to differentiate [based on] our principles.

210
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:48,000
I have talked about the fundamental 
principles I care about in blockchains.

211
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:54,340
Sometimes I call them the five pillars of open
blockchains, or the eight criteria. I lose count.

212
00:24:54,340 --> 00:25:00,900
It is somewhere between five and eight, but you should
always [scrutinize] a system that is trying to take over...

213
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:04,300
the foundational technology of money in your world.

214
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:14,220
Is it open? What does "open" mean? Is it open for
anyone to access and participate without vetting?

215
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:19,480
Can anyone send a transaction
without providing identification?

216
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:25,900
Is it? We don't know yet. We will see.
The white paper [claims] it is [open].

217
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:28,260
We [will need to wait and see for]
what the currency actually does.

218
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:31,700
Is it borderless? I can tell you right now,
it will not be borderless.

219
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:40,180
There is only one borderless, global cryptocurrency
of any value and meaning today. That is bitcoin.

220
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:51,580
It is maybe as good as the U.S. dollar at being
borderless. But Facebook will not be in China.

221
00:25:51,580 --> 00:26:01,520
I can guarantee you that Libra will not launch in China.
They will have their own, launched by WeChat.

222
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:09,960
Or a subsidiary wholly owned by the People's
Republic of China, the central politburo.

223
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:17,060
Like Facebook is a subsidiary of the NSA... [Laughter]

224
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:20,300
It will not launch in Russia either.

225
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:28,460
Are they going to give up their monetary 
sovereignty to a dude from Silicon Valley?

226
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:34,100
It will not launch in a bunch of other places 
with unbanked people who actually need this.

227
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:37,780
It will not be borderless. In fact, quite the opposite.

228
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:44,400
We have entered the era of
Cold War-esque currency wars.

229
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:51,720
An Iron Curtain for currencies will drop,
like we have never seen before.

230
00:26:51,720 --> 00:27:01,400
We will see a split between East and West 
in the evolution of state-based and corporate currencies.

231
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:07,300
Of the three, only open cryptocurrencies
will go everywhere [around the world].

232
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:10,720
[Libra] will probably not be neutral.

233
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:20,160
Neutrality requires that the protocol allow transactions
from anyone to anyone, [anywhere], for any purpose.

234
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:26,280
A lot of open cryptocurrencies do that.
I very much doubt that Libra will do that.

235
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:30,300
The moment they [allow] that, 
the subpoenas will start flying.

236
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:38,280
The most important [detail for] a subpoena is
knowing where to serve it, right? That will be easy.

237
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:44,360
They have an office which accepts service of process,
so that is where [governments] will send the subpoenas.

238
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:56,360
Where do you send the Bitcoin subpoenas? Aha!
Can you send them to 127.0.0.1 (localhost IP address)?

239
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:07,560
[Laughter] [Applause]
We will process them immediately.

240
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,380
So it will not be neutral.
It will not be censorship resistant.

241
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:19,280
Large corporations like that, bound by jurisdictional
regulations, are obliged to censor transactions.

242
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:27,260
[As an American], you cannot send a transaction
to an Iranian, a Venezuelan, or a North Korean.

243
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:34,320
You cannot receive [money] from a Russian or Chinese
citizen without properly vetting who they are,

244
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:41,820
who their parents are, when they were born, 
where they live, and which companies they own.

245
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:46,600
This happens every time you try to send a wire transfer.

246
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:51,640
[Libra] will not be immutable. They say in
the white paper that [it will be] immutable,

247
00:28:51,640 --> 00:29:00,640
but the moment you make a transaction funding
some abhorrent and inexcusable activity,

248
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:07,880
subpoenas will start flying and the "immutable"
network will be muted pretty damn fast.

249
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:15,640
That is pretty easy to do when you have a consortium
of validators and no cost for modifying the history.

250
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:24,720
Proof-of-work makes it [practically] impossible, even
if 100% of the miners collude and try to change history,

251
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,620
without expending the same amount of energy.

252
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:39,840
This means with every day that passes, the energy cost 
increases. Within a day or two, it is an undue burden.

253
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:47,580
It is almost impossible, even if you could find and coerce
all of the miners. They wouldn't be able to do it.

254
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:53,080
It is not "won't," it is "can't."
Can't is much better than won't.

255
00:29:53,080 --> 00:30:00,460
[But Libra] will not be immutable. It might be 
auditable and transparent. We don't know yet.

256
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:05,620
If it is audible and transparent, it will not be private.

257
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:16,600
We are probably only a few years from a giant freaking
leak, where all of your financial data 'are belong to us.'

258
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,380
Again. [Laughter]

259
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:27,500
If it is stored in the blockchain in a transparent
manner and you don't have any privacy controls --

260
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:34,780
you know, the kind that "criminals" use,
but at least they are smart about privacy --

261
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:38,520
all of that information will be leaked.

262
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:45,100
All of your purchases will now
be visible to friends and family.

263
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:53,980
[Each of us] probably has a very good friend 
we've made a pact with: "If I get hit by a bus,

264
00:30:53,980 --> 00:31:04,860
I need you to take my laptop, erase my browsing history,
and shred all of my bank statements... [Laughter]

265
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:10,820
before my mom gets to the house.
[Do we understand each other]?"

266
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:15,740
Financial privacy is a human right.
Society doesn't work as a panopticon.

267
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:23,460
We have secrets because we're social animals. That
gives us the freedom to express our freaky nature.

268
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:32,700
We all differ a bit from the expectations and 
conformity of society. At least, I hope we do.

269
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:42,340
Because if we don't, what kind of society is that?
[Must we] absolutely conform to the expectations...

270
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:45,640
of your stuck-up neighbors?

271
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:50,820
Individuality, expression, freedom is privacy.

272
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:57,860
We don't want our financial records blasted 
to the world. But that will happen next [with Libra].

273
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:07,740
It may be auditable and transparent, but not very
private. This is not a blockchain I'm interested in.

274
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:15,880
More importantly, as I have said many times 
before, we are standing at a fork in the road.

275
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:24,440
On the one hand, we have surveillance money. On the
other, we have free, open, and private people's money.

276
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:36,320
Guess what will happen with this new currency?
The timetable to cashless societies has accelerated.

277
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:45,360
Cashless societies are nothing to celebrate. 
They [will be] without freedom or democracy.

278
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:58,200
They are fragile, without the possibility of an exit plan
or release valve. Where one election could be the last.

279
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:04,280
You only need to get it wrong once. Just stay
at home and say, "I don't care about politics."

280
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:11,440
All of the kooky old people go out and vote for 
an orange man, Brexit, or some shit like that.

281
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:16,520
You ask, "What the hell happened?"

282
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:21,000
In a world where you don't have cash,
it is much worse than that.

283
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:28,060
The government, a corporation, or payment processor
can decide that you have done something "bad,"

284
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:30,540
and turn off your financial future.

285
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:35,860
They could make sure that you can't even 
buy food, let alone pay for rent or [utilities].

286
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:39,360
If you think this isn't happening,
it is happening right now in Hong Kong.

287
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,800
It is happening in China with
the Sesame credit score system.

288
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:50,940
If you think that is not coming to a country like yours,
study up on European history, [like] 1918 through 1945.

289
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:58,180
Fascinating shit. We thought
the U.K. had learned that lesson.

290
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:04,000
From what I have been seeing lately, [nope].
They are trying to repeat all of [that]. Great.

291
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:10,240
Sometimes you need to teach the lesson twice.
What will we do in the crypto space?

292
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:13,140
We will start differentiating.

293
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:22,460
Over the next couple of years, expect a lot of 
crypto projects to focus on what their principles are.

294
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:29,760
Now, there is a lot of confusion. We are dealing with
an 18-dimensional, partial differential equation...

295
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,340
of a three-body problem.

296
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:37,600
Everything is pulling on everything else.
Six degrees of freedom. It is very complicated.

297
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,380
Who knows will happen next?
Look, Facebook went to India.

298
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:45,260
Uh, India wants to devalue [the rupee]. Indian people are
going into cryptocurrency; others are being blocked.

299
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:53,380
What happens next? Nobody knows! If you are a crypto
project, you must decide what your principles are.

300
00:34:53,380 --> 00:35:03,540
I have been expressing the same consistent 
principles for the last seven years. [Applause]

301
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:09,680
The reason is really simple: it takes too much
bloody homework to [shift between different ones],

302
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:15,560
and remember how to be consistent with what I said
before, if I'm not following what I actually believe in.

303
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:21,640
Some people in our industry noticed that recently.
Inconsistencies can happen very quickly.

304
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:26,800
Some crypto projects recently
faced that kind of fork in the road.

305
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:35,100
They decided to focus on different principles and
tried to change the trajectory of projects we care about.

306
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:45,620
Lately, one of them is all about cheap payments,
at the expense of decentralisation and privacy.

307
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:52,480
Apparently, to the people [involved in it], privacy 
is only useful for illegals and money launderers...

308
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,440
who are [engaging in] wash trading and bucket shops.

309
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:08,500
Ooh, scary! [Laughter] If that is the road you want to
go down, the light you see is not the end of the tunnel...

310
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:17,420
but an oncoming Facebook train that already has
the principle-less, privacy-less market staked out.

311
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:24,740
They already have two billion users, lots of money
and technology people who will run right over you.

312
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:32,100
If you haven't differentiated based on your principles
-- or worse, you don't have any principles --

313
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:39,400
and decided with your recently hired MBA that you are
really interested in shareholder return on investment,

314
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:51,120
and the best way to do that means shedding 
a few of these "silly," "idealistic" principles,

315
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,240
then guess what?

316
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:58,840
Once you start shedding principles,
now you're [competing against] Facebook.

317
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:06,300
What is Facebook, if not the world's most 
[powerful] principle shedding machine? [Laughter]

318
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:12,960
It started with few [principles to begin with], and has
since developed a mechanism for shedding them...

319
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:18,860
faster than you can imagine, with billions of dollars
in marketing tickling your dopamine receptors.

320
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:26,260
"Don't worry! The future is candy colored
and bright... as long as we are still profitable."

321
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:32,960
They can shed principles faster than you, 
with more money, better user interfaces,

322
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,460
and a bigger user base than you.

323
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:39,800
So if your game is shedding principles to 
make profit, that is a game you will not win.

324
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:45,740
Facebook will win that game.
They will win it over PayPal and JPMorgan Chase.

325
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:51,560
They will sure as hell gonna win it over a little ragtag
crypto project that says, "We don't need privacy."

326
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,500
"We just want to be a fast payment network...

327
00:37:53,500 --> 00:38:01,720
that collaborates with law enforcement 
and [enables] surveillance [capitalism]."

328
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,500
Figure out what your principles are.

329
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:18,280
Everybody will need to stop, take a breath, and figure out
how to differentiate. It is actually pretty easy.

330
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:29,000
If you get into a fight with someone who doesn't
hold principles, a corporation, that is not immoral,

331
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,700
because that requires having negative morality.

332
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:41,060
[They are] amoral, which means no moral guidance
whatsoever. The absence of any moral compass.

333
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:49,760
Morality doesn't even enter their ROI equation.
Morality is not on the spreadsheet.

334
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:56,440
If you are going to pick a fight with them,
differentiate on the thing they can't compete with:

335
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:10,240
align yourself with the one project that is truly open,
borderless, neutral, censorship resistant, transparent,

336
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:15,220
auditable, private, and immutable.

337
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:22,840
There are a few of those, I think.
Privacy currencies will get quite a run [for their money].

338
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:32,780
There is a [growing need] to really focus
on privacy, because Facebook won't.

339
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:42,520
Things just got really interesting.
As a technologist, I am so excited.

340
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:50,300
I have been jumping up and down all day.
I can't wait to see how this plays out.

341
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:57,620
That has been my lifelong fascination: watching
technological systems interact with society...

342
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:59,500
and change the world.

343
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:06,700
As these developments roll out, I will see if I can pick up
a few clues as to where these things are going.

344
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:14,520
To have that vision has been my life's goal.
As a technologist, I have been jumping up and down.

345
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:26,740
As a human being, I am horrified that we are opening
the door to a future that is truly terrifying and dystopian.

346
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:33,000
We are giving power to some of the most ruthless, 
unaccountable corporations out there.

347
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:40,280
Not to fight against governments,
but in many cases to join them hand-in-hand.

348
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:45,940
They will ensure that while we're exploited 
by ruthless politicians on one side,

349
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:54,840
we are also exploited by ruthless business people on
the other, in an alliance between corporation and state.

350
00:40:54,840 --> 00:41:00,620
That is called fascism,
only this isn't your grandpa's fascism.

351
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:06,280
This is a whole neo-feudal environment
that we have never seen before.

352
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:15,020
A lot of people will make the mistake [of assuming]
that if it doesn't come in a leather uniform designed...

353
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:30,300
by Hugo Boss, with clashing colors, caricature parades,
and screaming into megaphones, it is not fascism.

354
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:38,280
But fascism today can come in a slick user interface with
beautiful colors, accessible 24/7, through your browser...

355
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:46,120
and the most convenient location
whether your phone is on or off.

356
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:57,560
It is part of your life. It allows you to share 
photos with Grandpa, the same one who fought Nazis.

357
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:00,680
It is the ultimate irony.

358
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:06,260
We need to be very careful about what
we do next. This is deadly serious stuff.

359
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:10,260
Society is not ready for this
because we've never been here before.

360
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:16,180
While I am fascinated to watch,
at the same time, I am deeply troubled.

361
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:24,900
I am not afraid because I think Bitcoin can't compete.
I am afraid because I believe a lot of people don't care.

362
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:38,020
A lot of people will go for the easy, convenient,
mindless, repetitive, seductive, hypnotizing rhythm...

363
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:49,120
of a Facebook feed, through which they will lose
their freedom and their future. Thank you. [Applause]
